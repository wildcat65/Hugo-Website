      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today should have been Tams last day at school before the christmas break. It ended up not being that way.This morning he was spun up and running on empty after not getting much sleep. The time came to get ready and all hell broke loose. He got really upset and screaming. Asking for tight cuddles and asking &amp;lsquo;stay with daddy&amp;rsquo;. I pushed on.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Now just to get things straight I am not talking about a competetion in what follows. I am talking about supporting my son and part of that is understanding his complex behaviour and seeing things from his point of view.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow is Tam&amp;rsquo;s last day at what I would call junior school. He moves up to senior school in September. It&amp;rsquo;s really the same school but a different site a few hundred metres away. It feels like a big change for him and me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I am not totally sure of my reasons for writing a blog or a book at the moment. All I know is that the main subject that I have been writing about, my son, his autism and grief are important to me. I have looked for research and guidance on the web and elsewhere and have found little of substance. There might be on Facebook and maybe stuff is hidden on there, but I am not on Facebook.</description>
