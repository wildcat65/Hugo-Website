      <description>During the time since Bev died a particular kind of music and a particular band have given both me and Tam a lot of solice. That band is Alterbridge. A rock band that I don&amp;rsquo;t like to put in a particular pigeon hole, they are Alterbridge.
Bev came to know Alterbridge through me and loved the vibe of the band and she loved the loud songs but also loved the quieter songs that they do.</description>
