      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s 3:30 in the morning and Tam is busy on the computer recording himself reading into the computer. Once he is finished we play it back and read the book together with the recording playing. We then work on the word he does not read clearly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Looking after Tam and myself can be tough. Over the past few days it has been really tough. Yesterday Tam was sick. Nothing he had eaten that I can blame but he kept purging for hours and it became too much. I pleaded with him to go to bed and rest as I was not coping.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The last few days have seen us doing homeschooling, building and rebuilding our fort, tidying, reorganising DVD&amp;rsquo;s, and finally going out shopping. It has been a time fraught with anxiety. It has been a peculiar time and will no doubt continue to be weird.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last night was the best nights sleep for both me and Tam. Tam did not wake once. No crying, no bad dreams, just sleep. This morning he still has his cough, but again it is on and off. No temperature for now, just a lad who is glad to be home and lying on the sofa watching a cowboy movie. He loves the old movies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tam has been a sweaty boy during the night. Asking for ice cubes and drinking lots. Checked his temp and it appears &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo;. For the most part he is behaving like he has a cold, just this time it is lasting more than a day. Normally when he gets a cold he just wants to sleep it off and that lasts a day. This is turning out to be a little different. He still has a tickly cough but it comes and goes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
