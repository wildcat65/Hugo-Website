      <description>With everything going on in the world why are the kids going back to school?
Oh this all feels so wrong right now. Tam was hating school before the shutdown. He was kicking scratching and biting me on a night once he realised he was going to school the next day. He was fighting in the morning getting ready and this continued getting him into the taxi. He was coming home with ripped tshirts.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Shoulder injury, missing Bev more every day, worrying about Tam going back to school, tiredness are all adding up to a real crappy time. I feel so down and low.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Living with a person with autism is full of extremes. Being the lone parent of your child with autism is even more full of extremes. At times the easiest thing to do is to surrender, hang out the white flag and run with them. Forget about all of the things that life used to be and just run with them. Operate in their version of the world for a bit, see if you can make sense of it. Sometimes I have been able to and sometimes it just remains a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Looking after Tam and myself can be tough. Over the past few days it has been really tough. Yesterday Tam was sick. Nothing he had eaten that I can blame but he kept purging for hours and it became too much. I pleaded with him to go to bed and rest as I was not coping.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Three more sleeps to go and Tam is back at school. Lots to do. With the biggest thing to achieve is to get Tam back in the routine of getting ready and going to school.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Be Good to Yourself</title>

      <guid>https://ghostdogs.co.uk/blog/be-good-to-yourself/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the things I was told early on in this journey was to &amp;ldquo;be good to yourself&amp;rdquo;. I was told this by medical professional, social services, friends, Tams teachers. At the time I could not see how to do this and also what difference it would make. I really could not see how to be good to myself. I had no idea.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the best ways for me to learn is to reflect on my actions and look for progress in as many ways as I can. This process can be a bit rough as I am no where near perfect and if the truth be known I am a pretty faulty version of what is commonly known as the human race.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tam has had a few weeks of fairly decent sleep patterns. 2-6 hours of sleep. It&amp;rsquo;s funny what becomes decent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past week I have had the opportunity to speak with some parents of children with varying special needs. The parents varied from a single parent like myself to normal families with help from siblings or the wider family. I used the opportunity to listen and also to share a little bit. It is all too easy to sound like a victim when talking about the situation that you find yourself in. I am especially aware that even writing this that I can come across as playing the victim. It is my hope that people realise that I am not trying to play the victim and that I am just talking about the situation that I find myself in.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Now just to get things straight I am not talking about a competetion in what follows. I am talking about supporting my son and part of that is understanding his complex behaviour and seeing things from his point of view.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
