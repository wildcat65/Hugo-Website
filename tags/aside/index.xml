      <description>Today we went to the cinema. We went to a relaxed viewing which means the sound is turned down and the lights are set low. The expectation is that all kinds of kids will be there and pretty much any behaviour is to be expected. It did however hit me that the neuro-typical kids made more noise and caused more disruption. Go figure.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a subject I was going to stay away from but I have had loads of emails, mostly from America on the subject of autism &amp;lsquo;cures&amp;rsquo; and how to make Tam well again. I have to say I was surprised and was not expecting the number of emails but the content has been sickening. I would have much preferred spam about anything else.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
