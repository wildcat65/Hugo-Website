      <description>Any parent knows that when their child is ill that it is the most worrying of times. When a child is a bit quiet and complains of a belly ache any normal parent thinks a couple of polar opposite things at the same time. &amp;ldquo;I told you to stop eating so many strawberries&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;its appendicitis, and it about to burst&amp;rdquo;, both of these are normal reactions and you talk to your child to help make the decision as to what it is and before you get a chance to work it out they left off a large fart and are off playing again.</description>
