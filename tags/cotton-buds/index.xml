      <description>September used to be a busy month, now its full of memories.
It is Tam&amp;rsquo;s 12th Birthday, my birthday and Bev&amp;rsquo;s birthday. Bev would have been 51 on the 10th. She was too young to go. I have stopped caring about my birthday. The thing I liked about my birthday was ringing my Mam at 7:30pm and wishing her a happy birthday, she did all of the hard work after all.</description>
