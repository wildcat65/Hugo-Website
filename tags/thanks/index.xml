      <description>&lt;p&gt;The past week has been a good one. Starting Monday to Friday morning Tam slept exceptionally well for 3 out of the 4 nights. Down early and up early but solid uninterrupted sleep. It was absolutely brilliant. I felt rested, and he looked much more rested.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Tam has just blown me away and made me cry in the best possible way. He walked up to me and signed to me and said out loud - &amp;ldquo;Tam Love Daddy&amp;rdquo; 14:30 Sunday 13th October 2019</description>
