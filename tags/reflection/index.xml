      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dropping Tam off at the respite centre was hard, especially after being at the beach with him all day. The drop off was quick and consisted of a kiss and a bye-bye. I hoped that all of the preparation had worked. I have talked to Tam many times about him staying at the centre and having an adventure and sleep over. With his lack of verbal comebacks it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to totally understand how much he understands. One part of me is that he understands almost everything, then there is the doubt and I think he is being thrown into things with no understanding and just terror and anxiety of what the hell is Dad doing, where has he gone. I wish I knew.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
