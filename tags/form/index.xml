      <description>I have spent the past month trying to fill in the Disability Living Allowance (DLA) form for Tam. It is a horrendous form. Today I managed to finish it. I can hear you ask why did it take so long. Well it a little window into looking after an autistic, anxious, grieving boy.
Tam constantly wants and needs attention. Firstly to keep him safe. Even at home he could eat something that is non edible or bit a chunk out of something and get himself into difficulty very quickly.</description>
