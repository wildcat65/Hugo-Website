      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest steps I have taken with Tam is putting him into respite. So far it has been 1 or 2 nights in a lovely place that is especially for kids with autism. The staff are fantastic and do an excellent job of helping the kids to adjust to a new environment. I really could not ask for more from them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
