      <description>This is a subject I was going to stay away from but I have had loads of emails, mostly from America on the subject of autism &amp;lsquo;cures&amp;rsquo; and how to make Tam well again. I have to say I was surprised and was not expecting the number of emails but the content has been sickening. I would have much preferred spam about anything else.
Of all the emails the majority talk about these Miracle Supplement available on the internet.</description>
