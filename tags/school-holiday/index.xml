      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was not one of those kids that hated school, For me school was boring and the teachers struggled to keep me interested. Tam however loves school. It gives him the structure and engagement that he needs. Now matter how hard I try it is difficult to keep up the level of engagement that school gives him.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
