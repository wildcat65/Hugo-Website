      <title>Complaint</title>

      <description>Complaint and correction I got an email from someone (I said I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t) that I was spending too much time complaining on the website and I should talk more about the solutions to Tam and my problems. After a bit of a conversation and a read back they are right. The posts are a bit &amp;ldquo;poor me&amp;rdquo;. I do stand by my reasoning to begin with. They are written from the point of view of a grieving Dad, a Dad that is also grieving for the loss his son has had and how they have added to his life challenges.</description>

      <title>October is here</title>

      <description>October is here It&amp;rsquo;s a week since Tams birthday and it has been a real tough week. Tam was sent home on his birthday from school. He was full of anxiety and was asking me to swap his birthday presents for mammy. Heartbreaking. The truth is I would give everything for him to have his mammy.
He came back from school all upset and got even more upset when I told him that he was not back at school for a while.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the longest of times both me and Bev would ask the support staff at school and in the medical profession - &amp;ldquo;when will Tam speak?&amp;rdquo;. None of them would give an answer. Now I get why. Every child is different and every autistic child is even more different.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nocturnal life is common amongst geeks. I have stayed up until the early hours and then got up at 6am and headed off to work, with a couple of hours of sleep. As I have got older, I have become less and less able to do it. Now, as a single parent of Tam, I have had to learn how to do it again. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Its Sunday at 11pm and Tam has been asleep on and off all day. 30 minutes here and hour there. A couple of hours ago he threw up. Still not sure if it was stress or ill. I can normally tell by the smell but this time I think it was half and half. Let&amp;rsquo;s put it this way, I cannot send him to school.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am going to start off by saying I am nothing special. I am a dad nothing more nothing less. My brain is analytical, it&amp;rsquo;s good at pattern matching and fire fighting. Give me a bad IT situation and I will find a way to get it back to a good situation. I know I have faults, some major faults and I work on them every day.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Half term is over, respite was a success and the first 2 days at school took place. First day went fine, first night was great. My little lad was full of fun and knackered. He slept well. Second morning went ok but had a lot of tears as I sent him off to school. All however changed tonight.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the things I was told early on in this journey was to &amp;ldquo;be good to yourself&amp;rdquo;. I was told this by medical professional, social services, friends, Tams teachers. At the time I could not see how to do this and also what difference it would make. I really could not see how to be good to myself. I had no idea.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know if this is a thing, but whenever I have got myself to a break of more than a few days I always end up sick for the first few days. The last few days at work have been so hectic and then time off and illness. Always seemed to happen, the same thing used to happen to Bev. Not sure other people have the same thing. One thing I do know is Tam has the same reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wednesday morning and Tam was on the road to getting off to school and he started to vomit. My mind was whiring. Was he really this anxious. In the months after Bevs death I was having panic attacks where I vomitted, was Tam at the horrible point?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As parents life is full of worry. It does not matter what kind of child you have its full of worry. The only thing different in being a parent of an autistic child is that you have to decipher each situation. The obvious answer is not always the answer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://ghostdogs.co.uk/blog/enigma-wrapped/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tam like any child with autism that is non verbal (or minimally verbal) is difficult to read. I often describe as &amp;ldquo;an enigma wrapped in a mystery stuffed in an envelope and packed into a crate&amp;rdquo;. No matter how I can read some of Tams behaviours and find ways to comfort him there is always a time when every thing I think and every action I take does not work and misses the mark that Tam needs me to find. This is frustrating for both of us.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If anyone dares to tell me that Tams current anxiety and stress is not related to school I think I will end up in the mental hospital. What I am writing took place on Friday afternoon or Saturday. It&amp;rsquo;s currently 4:11am on Sunday morning and for once we are all calm and quiet.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s currently 2:35am and after Tam had been down for a while he woke up crying and asking about school. It has taken about an hour to calm him.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a load of posts that I have been working on that just need a bit more work. The problem is that Tam is creating a lot of work and worry at the moments. It&amp;rsquo;s only Tuesday night and this is what we have had so far.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tam has come home from school. He looks tired and loaded with cold. He could not be bothered with going out to the shops or for something to eat and cried when I asked him. So pyjama night it is. Wednesday nights are always Starbucks nights, a carry over from when Bev would take him out to meet a friend in town.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I look back at the past few years and try to understand everything that I have lost. I have lost my Dad, my Mam to dementia and then to death, and my love and sole mate Bev so very suddenly. Taken too soon. I try to take in all of that loss and work out how to become less fragile and how to nurse my tiny little soul back to some form of semblance of order again.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the best ways for me to learn is to reflect on my actions and look for progress in as many ways as I can. This process can be a bit rough as I am no where near perfect and if the truth be known I am a pretty faulty version of what is commonly known as the human race.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A change is as good as a rest, that&amp;rsquo;s a saying I have always appreciated in my life. Then life throws a change at you that you don&amp;rsquo;t want and it is anything but a rest. In fact it becomes the most heartbreaking, stressful and disturbing event of your life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest steps I have taken with Tam is putting him into respite. So far it has been 1 or 2 nights in a lovely place that is especially for kids with autism. The staff are fantastic and do an excellent job of helping the kids to adjust to a new environment. I really could not ask for more from them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have spent quite a lot of time looking into any information that I can find on separation anxiety. Most of it is about the mental health aspect of it, some of it is about methods of coping with typical kids starting school or playgroups. Very little of it is about separation anxiety caused by grief. Either I am missing the point and it is inherent in the condition of grief and is taken as said or that not many people have looked at the situation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tam went back to school today. He was real confused this morning. After thousands of times asking &amp;ldquo;going to school tomorrow&amp;rdquo; he was getting ready for school. It caused a little bit of panic as he had to get some things in place ready for him leaving. All weird stuff like his star projector has to be facing a certain way in his bedroom. He has to use his iPad and Kindle to watch particular things in the morning. He has to have his chair sideways when he gets his breakfast. All weird stuff but it makes him happy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have spent the past month trying to fill in the Disability Living Allowance (DLA) form for Tam. It is a horrendous form. Today I managed to finish it. I can hear you ask why did it take so long. Well it a little window into looking after an autistic, anxious, grieving boy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past week I have had the opportunity to speak with some parents of children with varying special needs. The parents varied from a single parent like myself to normal families with help from siblings or the wider family. I used the opportunity to listen and also to share a little bit. It is all too easy to sound like a victim when talking about the situation that you find yourself in. I am especially aware that even writing this that I can come across as playing the victim. It is my hope that people realise that I am not trying to play the victim and that I am just talking about the situation that I find myself in.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Autism and Grief</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Kubler-Ross definition of the stages of grief are listed as Denial, Anger, Bargaining, Depression and Acceptance. I understand the principle behind these stages but they are very much a simplification of the grieving process. Everyone grieves differently and the cause of the grief also causes the grief to rotate in different directions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was not one of those kids that hated school, For me school was boring and the teachers struggled to keep me interested. Tam however loves school. It gives him the structure and engagement that he needs. Now matter how hard I try it is difficult to keep up the level of engagement that school gives him.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The hardest haircut</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As all parents of autistic kids know getting a haircut for their child can be a nightmare. The smells and noises of a barber or hairdresser shop can be overwhelming. It is not a good experience for anyone involved unless you find a smart, compassionate and patient soul to help with the situation. We did and this is the story.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last night Tam asked &amp;ldquo;to go to the pictures to see Angry Birds 2&amp;rdquo;. Plain as day, best speech so far. So chuffed that we went online and checked what was on at the pictures. No luck. Angry Birds 2 starts 2nd August.&lt;br&gt;
As we were looking Tam pointed at Spiderman - Far from home. &amp;ldquo;Go to the pictures, Spiderman far from home&amp;rdquo;, again as clear as can be. Wow. Ok Tam we go to the pictures and see Spiderman.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Now just to get things straight I am not talking about a competetion in what follows. I am talking about supporting my son and part of that is understanding his complex behaviour and seeing things from his point of view.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tam is at times very difficult to engage. His favourite things are tickles and rough and tumble. After that its his iPad and TV remote. By TV remote I mean that Tam has ultimate control of the TV with the ability to change channel and fast forward and rewind.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Today we went to the cinema. We went to a relaxed viewing which means the sound is turned down and the lights are set low. The expectation is that all kinds of kids will be there and pretty much any behaviour is to be expected. It did however hit me that the neuro-typical kids made more noise and caused more disruption. Go figure.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today me and Tam were separated for longest time. We spent 6 hours apart on a weekend. Yes, we are separate when Tam goes to school. This was only the second time in the last 18 months that we have been separate, but the last time I was in the same building. Today Tam went to a respite centre with me and I left him there. He went off to the beach and I went home.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Any parent knows that when their child is ill that it is the most worrying of times. When a child is a bit quiet and complains of a belly ache any normal parent thinks a couple of polar opposite things at the same time. &amp;ldquo;I told you to stop eating so many strawberries&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;its appendicitis, and it about to burst&amp;rdquo;, both of these are normal reactions and you talk to your child to help make the decision as to what it is and before you get a chance to work it out they left off a large fart and are off playing again. It&amp;rsquo;s normal. Absolutely normal. When that does not happen and you end up in A&amp;amp;E at 2 in the morning well that&amp;rsquo;s a different story all together.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I am not totally sure of my reasons for writing a blog or a book at the moment. All I know is that the main subject that I have been writing about, my son, his autism and grief are important to me. I have looked for research and guidance on the web and elsewhere and have found little of substance. There might be on Facebook and maybe stuff is hidden on there, but I am not on Facebook.</description>
