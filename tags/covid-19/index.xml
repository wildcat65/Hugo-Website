      <description>&lt;p&gt;The last few days have seen us doing homeschooling, building and rebuilding our fort, tidying, reorganising DVD&amp;rsquo;s, and finally going out shopping. It has been a time fraught with anxiety. It has been a peculiar time and will no doubt continue to be weird.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tam has been a sweaty boy during the night. Asking for ice cubes and drinking lots. Checked his temp and it appears &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo;. For the most part he is behaving like he has a cold, just this time it is lasting more than a day. Normally when he gets a cold he just wants to sleep it off and that lasts a day. This is turning out to be a little different. He still has a tickly cough but it comes and goes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday Tam was getting back to normal. This morning he woke with a cough. It was not the usual cough but enough of a cough to be a worry. It went on for a couple of hours and was joined with a couple of sneezes and some sniffling. Temperature was OK but with Tam temperature is never a good indicator. He seems to have a standard temperature of 36C.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
