      <description>I have had a couple of days to reflect on the past week and what me and Tam are doing. It has taken a couple of days because of panic attacks that I have had with some of the stuff me and Tam need to do.
To be specific I will use one time which was dropping off Tam at the respite centre. After dropping him off I went to get the bus back home.</description>
