      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the longest of times both me and Bev would ask the support staff at school and in the medical profession - &amp;ldquo;when will Tam speak?&amp;rdquo;. None of them would give an answer. Now I get why. Every child is different and every autistic child is even more different.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday Tam was getting back to normal. This morning he woke with a cough. It was not the usual cough but enough of a cough to be a worry. It went on for a couple of hours and was joined with a couple of sneezes and some sniffling. Temperature was OK but with Tam temperature is never a good indicator. He seems to have a standard temperature of 36C.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
