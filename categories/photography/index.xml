      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;bad-start&#34;&gt;Bad start&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over my adult life I have pretty much had a camera all of the time. Canon, Nikon, Olympus, Sony all kinds of cameras. I have used them for my own personal interests and also for work. I have always enjoyed photography and having the wonderful time of watching Tam grow up and the love he had for his mammy was great subject matter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
