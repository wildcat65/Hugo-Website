      <description>October is here It&amp;rsquo;s a week since Tams birthday and it has been a real tough week. Tam was sent home on his birthday from school. He was full of anxiety and was asking me to swap his birthday presents for mammy. Heartbreaking. The truth is I would give everything for him to have his mammy.
He came back from school all upset and got even more upset when I told him that he was not back at school for a while.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Half term is over, respite was a success and the first 2 days at school took place. First day went fine, first night was great. My little lad was full of fun and knackered. He slept well. Second morning went ok but had a lot of tears as I sent him off to school. All however changed tonight.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
