      <description>Complaint and correction I got an email from someone (I said I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t) that I was spending too much time complaining on the website and I should talk more about the solutions to Tam and my problems. After a bit of a conversation and a read back they are right. The posts are a bit &amp;ldquo;poor me&amp;rdquo;. I do stand by my reasoning to begin with. They are written from the point of view of a grieving Dad, a Dad that is also grieving for the loss his son has had and how they have added to his life challenges.</description>
