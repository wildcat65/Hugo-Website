      <description>Music for Healing A while a go I read Neil Peart&amp;rsquo;s book Ghost Rider - travels on the healing road. In it he talked about his tiny little soul and the alter-egos that he had. He was grieving for his daughter and wife who died over a short period of time. In case you don&amp;rsquo;t know the name Neil Peart he was the drummer in a band called Rush. If I say &amp;ldquo;Tom Sawyer&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Spirit of Radio&amp;rdquo; you might know them songs.</description>
