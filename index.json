    "body": "A little politics I have tried not to watch the news of what is happening around world and for the best part have stayed away from the television news. However, I feel that the talk of fake news and conspiracy theories being bandied around are getting to the point where humanity is showing that we have no future. If such a large percentage (and by that I mean anything more than 0.000000000000000001%) believe politicans, conspiracy theories to any more extent than entertainment, and politicians then we are truly doomed. Supposedly developed countries are acting like corrupt 3rd world countries that lack morales and common sense that the world has always needed.\nMy dad always said to take anything that happens in the world with a pinch of salt unless it affects you. Then decide what you are going to do about it and get on with it. Everything else does not matter. He always told me to be good to people and not take people on face value. He always seemed to see the good in people until they did something that he felt was wrong.\nWell, Dad the world has taken a bad turn since you died. A real bad turn. The world has gone crazy. Conspiracy theories about the government trying to control our very thoughts, a worldwide epidemic being made up by governments to take our rights away, politicians not even knowing the rules that they are putting place, and even more crap of sensationalising untruths and lies on the news for the sake of what? Racism, intolerance and money grabs are the only things that seem to be on the rise. What we need is tolerance, equity, care, social responsility and good health. Mix in with that trust, science (proper science not sensationalism) and patience. Not a difficult recipe I think but the world seems to have lost sight of these simple principles.\nI am at a loss as to how people think there is a new world order that is trying to control us. Even if they are lizard people from another planet why would they be any more controlled than humanity. Even if it was a super AI computer it would have been initially programmed by humans and therefore would have all of humanities stupidity. People have way too much confidence on politicans and business leaders to be intelligent. Most of the politicans and business leaders I have met are single focussed on one thing. Money. They are way to distracted by money to have the intelligence and focus to want a new world order. They are just people with an overriding drive for money. Conspiricy theorist, the press and people in general its easy, if money is attached to something then that is the drive. They see power as money and money as power. They do not have a higher reason.\nThe politicians of every country are not in politics for the good of their countrymen, they don\u0026rsquo;t really have long terms plans. Not Russia, America, China, Brazil, UK, Europe, no country has a government that really cares about its people. Face up to the fact that life is what each one of us makes it. Make your government answerable to what they do if it affects you. Get them to do the moral and right things. That would be a new world order. Demand honesty from the governments, it will make the politicans very uncomfortable having to tell the truth.\nI am pragmatic about humanities place in the universe. I see each of our lives as fleeting, when it\u0026rsquo;s done it done, no replay, no act 2. I also think that humanity is just Mother Earths experiment, and again it will be fleeting. Nothing lasts for ever. I find these thoughts to be reassuring, I know some would find them terrifying.\nThe spec of dust, Earth, that we all sit on is almost at the cusp of starting a new experiment, humanity is telling mother earth that the little inconvience she has thrown us is too much. Stupidity has taken over. Well Mother Earth have fun with the next experiment, don\u0026rsquo;t feel bad, don\u0026rsquo;t be tough on yourself. Humanity was an experiment. Maybe we have got to the point that we can not develop any further. Maybe the explanation as to why the cosmos is so quiet is that you have not cracked the stupidity gene. Try again pet, good luck and thanks for the ride, I enjoyed it for whats it worth. (NB : I would try the insects this time, I have a feeling they might do better)\nWell me and Tam are ignoring all of it other than I get some entertainment that makes me shake my head and think what has humanity come to. Between Tams problems and my grief for the loved ones I have lost I have no time for it. We are living our lives according to the wisdom of my Dad. The bits of the craziness that touches our lives I work through or around. Yes it is limiting but no more than I will allow it. Does it depress me? Not any more, let the idiots get on with it; right Dad?\nMy purpose in life is protect Tam and give him as many tools as he can cope with for his life. I will continue to be understanding and caring with people around me. Anything else is a waste of energy.\nTake Care\nAlan\n",

    "body": "Complaint and correction I got an email from someone (I said I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t) that I was spending too much time complaining on the website and I should talk more about the solutions to Tam and my problems. After a bit of a conversation and a read back they are right. The posts are a bit \u0026ldquo;poor me\u0026rdquo;. I do stand by my reasoning to begin with. They are written from the point of view of a grieving Dad, a Dad that is also grieving for the loss his son has had and how they have added to his life challenges.\nSo here goes, what has helped.\nRaise the white flag Be prepared to shout and fight for help. Don\u0026rsquo;t be too proud to ask for help (I was to begin with). Child support to be honest is like a war sometimes, and that is for the support agencies as well as you as a parent. Sometimes speaking softly and pointing out that you need help is enough. Somtimes you have to be stubborn, awkward, shouty, and downright demanding. Like a say Child Support is like a war and like all the times we have gone to war the government finds the money. So stand your ground, state your case clearly, and if you need to repeat your case add huge amounts of emotion and passion. Explain that if they don\u0026rsquo;t do something now then it will cost more later.\nPaperwork Be prepared to fill out forms after forms after forms. Unfortunetely they are part of the process of getting help. When you get a new form, read through it, don\u0026rsquo;t even try to fill it in. Then go through it and fill it out with pencil. Leave it for a day and then put pen to paper. Also don\u0026rsquo;t be frightened to ask for help. There are quite a few charities around that can help. At the end of the day if the social worker or support person does there job properly they should help otherwise it will just create more work for them. Use that arguement at every stage with any agency that you cross paths with.\nThings you will hear \u0026ldquo;Sorry but there have been a lot of cuts\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;no budget, council has had cuts to its budget\u0026rdquo; - bullshit. This is absolutely bullshit. Have a look on your local goverments website. If you see an acting head of a department work on them being paid over Â£400 per day and maybe a lot more. You see an acting head gets paid out of a different budget and the salary is not capped. Also check out your local goverment office at night, they are generally lite up like christmas trees. If the council has no budget then the acting heads should be forced into the capped salary, no expenses fulltime role. When I pointed that out no one argued.\n",

    "body": "Music for Healing A while a go I read Neil Peart\u0026rsquo;s book Ghost Rider - travels on the healing road. In it he talked about his tiny little soul and the alter-egos that he had. He was grieving for his daughter and wife who died over a short period of time. In case you don\u0026rsquo;t know the name Neil Peart he was the drummer in a band called Rush. If I say \u0026ldquo;Tom Sawyer\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Spirit of Radio\u0026rdquo; you might know them songs. Anyway I could really align with Neil about the feelings he was having. He talked about the fact that the only reason he carried on was because he could not die. He questioned how people survived after such a loss and when they did survive what came out of the other side.\nI have been a Rush fan since their first album in 1976. Neil passed away earlier this year and the world lost one of the best drummers ever seen and heard.\nOne thing that his book talks about the healing power of various things around us. For me its been music. I have revisited music from my youth, to discovering new albums. Over the past few years since Bev died 2 albums have stood out. Miles Kennedy - Year of the Tiger and Fish - Weltschmerz.\nFish and Marillion were a big part of my music in the early 80\u0026rsquo;s. I had the joy of seeing them live a few times. I don\u0026rsquo;t dance but I would bounce around like a nutter at Marillion concerts. I saw on my limited news feed that Fish had a new solo album out and that it was to be his last one. It is an absolute gem of an album from the call to arms that is the final track Weltschermz to the stunningly beautiful haunting Garden of Rememberence.\nFish covers more ground in less than 90 minutes than most artists can in there whole career. Sir you are THE WARRIOR POET. This is with out doubt the best music, poetry, story telling of the 21st century. Congratulations on such a meanginful and beautiful album of poetry, storytelling and music. Your voice is as majestic and strong as ever it drips passion and meaning through your beautiful storytelling and you have produced your best work ever. Talk about going out on a high.\nBack to you lot (sorry got lost in the moment). Please take a few minutes to watch or listen to the videos. They are both worthy of your time and are very different. For anyone who has had a loved one who has dementia I would ask that you get some tissues as Garden of Rememberance will make you cry. I know I did while just listening to the track, it stopped me in my tracks as my head soaked up the words. Then I saw the video online and cried for my Mam. Please watch you will not be disappointed. Give the Album a listen if you are dissappointed please see a doctor, there is something wrong with you.\n   He\u0026rsquo;s lost between the here and now Somewhere that he can\u0026rsquo;t be found She\u0026rsquo;s still here Her love a ghost of memory She\u0026rsquo;ll wait for an eternity He\u0026rsquo;s still here\n     ",

    "body": "October is here It\u0026rsquo;s a week since Tams birthday and it has been a real tough week. Tam was sent home on his birthday from school. He was full of anxiety and was asking me to swap his birthday presents for mammy. Heartbreaking. The truth is I would give everything for him to have his mammy.\nHe came back from school all upset and got even more upset when I told him that he was not back at school for a while. Thats a 180 degree turn from getting angry when I told him he was going to school. Now he gets angry when he cannot go to school. Poor boy cannot win.\nSo right now it is 1:03am and I have just calmed down from Tam being really angry and aggressive for the past 2 hours. I have spent half of that time wrapped around him while he tried to scratch, bite and head butt me. Right now he is back in bed with his tablet sniffing and gently crying. He is finally on the way down, he has his kisses and a tight hug and I have wiped away his tears and now the calmness is returning to him. With a little bit of luck he will be asleep soon.\nAll of his anger seems to resolve around going to school and respite. All he wants to do is go to the shop and park with daddy. All the time he was fighting he was talking about no school and no respite. All the bites, scratches and head butts I have had tonight have been sandwiched between him asking \u0026ldquo;No School\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;No respite\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;go to park with daddy\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;go to shops with daddy\u0026rdquo;. I have given it a label of separation anxiety and it feels to be the right label. It does not make it easier but at least I can call it something.\nNow just to place all of this into a little bit of clarity, when Tam gets to school he enjoys it, at respite Tam is full of giggles and has loads of fun. I have seen plenty of photos of him at both places and I see plenty of smiles and I can see from his posture he is relaxed. So its not fear of going to these places that is the problem. Its the transition and the thought of leaving me. I do my best to explain these things to him and sometimes it works. All I have right now is that Tam is off to respite tomorrow for a couple of nights. I have to transition him carefully and quickly tomorrow morning and hopefully he will be ok.\nTams birthday has really screwed him up again after making progress with his anxiety and pulling away from using drugs to help with his anxiety. It will probably takes a few weeks for him to calm down. Problem then is we will have christmas coming towards us at a very fast rate. That brings on a whole load more memories.\nPoor kid cannot win.\nStay safe\nAlan \u0026amp; Tam\n",

They took steps and worked towards improving every flight and taking it further than the previous flight. Learning as they went along and improving the previous stages. That is what I have decided to do with my little project.\nOutline I want a program that will generate a markdown file for feeding the Hugo webserver. The markdown file will be a blog post or page which has a TOML header and a markdown body.\nThe TOML header looks like this\n+++ title = \u0026#39;New Blog Post\u0026#39; date = \u0026#34;Sun Sep 27 03:07:54 2020\u0026#34; draft = false tags = [\u0026#39;Birthday\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;Grief\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;Sorrow\u0026#39;] categories = [\u0026#34;Grief\u0026#34;] author = \u0026#34;Alan Greenwell\u0026#34; [[images]] src = \u0026#34;img/h-photo.jpg\u0026#34; alt = \u0026#34;Photo\u0026#34; stretch = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; +++ The rest of the file is just markdown formatted text. Hugo takes the TOML part of the file to place and format it correctly and renders the markdown as a webpage.\nNow for anyone that uses Hugo you will be screaming at the screen saying that Hugo does some of this anyway. Well I was to make Hugo work in my way and I also want to learn the Go Language.\nThe plan is to develop the program using the following steps.\nFirst Program Objective - Write out the TOML header to the console.\nSecond Program Objective - Write out the TOML header to a file.\nThird Program Write the TOML header out to a file and append a dummy blog post to the end of the file.\nFourth Program Pass file name and blog post name to the program and write out to a file.\nFifth Program Receive file and blog post name during program call. Request input for other items such as image name \u0026amp; title, category, tag and blog filename.\nSixth Program Make the whole experience graphical. Use a framework to make it work on Mac and Linux.\nSeventh Program Add a Markdown editor for the blog post.\nEighth Program Run hugo server after completion and sftp the generated website. Also perform Git commit.\nSumming up The intention is to put all of the code up during my posts but to also put the code on Github for anyone to reference, comment or improve. I know I will learn a lot through this process and maybe it will help someone else by posting this.\n Further Thought - I had envisioned all of this to be a windowed graphical app that works on MacOS and Linux. So I will need to do a parallel learning process using a Framework Library such as Fyne.io as my support. Probably will look at building the layout with input and output fields in one fell swoop. I will investigate. Some of this will be lacking error trapping and correction but it is something I will deal with as and when I start to feel more comfortable with each iteration.\n ",

    "body": "Go - Week 2 Day 1 Not much done as Tam refused to go to school and I have had to keep him calm all day. Not an easy day but ideas are formulating in my head for other projects.\nDay 2 All returning to normal. Go a bit of time today and looked at Fyne and played with the examples. For what I need to do it looks like it will do what I want. My mind needs to see of the building blocks to be able to continue, and if the graphical part looked like wizardry then I would have just stuck to a character interface for now. No, the building blocks look fine and I have an outline to work to so onwards and upwards.\nDay 3 The actual internal part of Go Language seems pretty simple. The organisation of it is very structured so I have moved onto checking out videos and continuing to read the books that I have. My method is to firstly be honest with myself. I read a chapter of the book, find a video or website on the item I have been reading and see if I feel like I know the subject well enough that I would only need a hint on syntax. Then finally I think about how I would teach it to someone who hasn\u0026rsquo;t programmed before.\nDay 4 Right now I am looking at slices. It feels like a simple enough concept but when I read some code that uses slices I get a little lost. This subject might take a bit longer.\nDay 5 OK, I have stepped away from slices and have started looking at GUI Frameworks. I think I have decided on Fyne. I have watched a couple of videos on developing a text editor type app and the presenter pretty much had it done in 20 minutes. Now I am not fooling myself that I understood all of the code and concepts but I get the drift of the process and could imagine the code running before he demonstrated it. Felt pretty happy with the process and watched a few more of the videos that they have put out. Check them out on YouTube, search for Fyne GoLang and look for the Fyne group.\nDay 6 Started to look at the Go Language packages. It is difficult to find a single source of all of the libraries and the functions other than the GoLang website https://golang.org/pkg/ but to be honest once you get used to the format it is easy enough and has some good examples.\nSo slices are waiting and I am reducing myself to understanding the contents of the packages. When I start this project fully then I want a reasonable handle on how to do thing. Is the io package that I need to do something or is there a better package with Fyne.\nDay 7 So week 2 and a couple of draft attempts have been written to get a handle on things. The attempts will probably look stupid and clumsy in a few weeks but they work for now. I was chuffed when each of them compiled and I could run them. I will upload them as examples for myself as well as people to look at my crappy first attempts at Go. They are what they are, working programs that don\u0026rsquo;t really do anything useful but they are steps on a jpurney.\n",

    "body": "At 3pm today 13 years ago the world welcomed Tam Samuel Greenwell. My beautiful son. Bev had to have an emergency C section as Tam had wiggled himself into nearly hanging himself on the umbilical cord. Kids!!!\nAll of my memories of the day relate around Bev and Tam. My awe in Bev\u0026rsquo;s bravery and this long scraggly little boy that we had brought into the world. The biggest memory I have is seeing Bev\u0026rsquo;s eyes widen when I showed her Tam. The tears flowed and she was lost in him. My love for Tam was one thing but seen Tam and Bev and the way they went on I was always in awe of them. Tam would settle straight away when he put his head on her chest and could hear her heartbeat. Never worked for me. I was for tickles, feeds and burping. I was never jealous of that bond they had I was just in awe and privileged to witness it and be part of it.\nTam has been robbed of the love that his mammy could provide that I cannot. I have tried to provide it but it was mammies love and I am his dad. He expects certain things from me, not what mammy gave him.\nLast night talking about pressies and his birthday Tam became very upset. He was already showing lots of anxiety but the level of upset went real high very quickly. He wanted his mammy. His words were \u0026ldquo;no presents only mammy\u0026rdquo;. My heart crumbled. Bev would be inconsolable if she heard him. This came and went all night. His ability to sit still or even sleep disappeared. He was all over the place and the best I could do was plant myself in one place for him to yo-yo back and forth to for cuddles and loves. Telling him to sit still or calm him down is no use, its not he won\u0026rsquo;t its he cannot.\nThis morning has been no different. He cannot settle. With everything else going on, he just cannot settle.\nBirthdays are not getting any easier. In fact they are getting harder for both of us. The hole just gets bigger in our lives as we have more birthdays.\nAll that said I am trying my best to have a low key birthday for Tam. I am speading his pressies out over the day and not making a fuss. He has enough going on in his head and I do not want to make it worse. My best plan of action has been to just leave boxes lying around and let him find them.\nTake care\nAlan \u0026amp; Tam\n",

None of them would give an answer. Now I get why. Every child is different and every autistic child is even more different.\nSince lockdown me and Tam have been using as many different ways to improve his speech. Tam has always been a little quiet and his speech is slurred. So I thought that the best approach to begin with was to get him \u0026ldquo;proud and loud\u0026rdquo;.\nOne of the ways we do this is by reading something and recording it into the computer. I make it so he can see the waveform of his voice and I challenge him to make the colours brighter. Once we have done that we play it back. First to just listen to and then again to go over the words where he is quiet or just not pronouncing the words. We do this a few times and then he gets to pick a video to watch on the computer screen.\nNow with all this said it has to be fun. Fun for Tam and fun for me. There is no faking it. If Tam senses its a drag then he won\u0026rsquo;t want to do it. If we are laughing and having fun he will try his best and progress will come.\n",

    "body": "Go - Week 1 So I have a few web pages bookmarked. I have bought an analogue book and off we go on a journey to flexing my tiny little brain again. Over the past couple of years my brain has taken a beating (as well as my heart) and now I need to get it on line and operating properly.\nMonday 21st September 2020\nOpen disclosure, I am not a stranger to programming. In recent year I have mostly written scripts and small python programs to strip files and search logs but I know my way around Python, Perl and Bash scripting. Years ago I was a programmer using COBOL, Forth, Pascal, Nomad, and a few others. I know the frustration that programming can bring but I also remember the elation in delivering a new program to fulfil a business or personal requirement.\nSo what is the focus that I have decided on. Well I want to build a simple editor that puts together TOML and MarkDown files for use with a web server. I have written out a synopsis of the features that I want and I have broken down a stepwise approach to fulfilling this goal.\nI am not putting myself under any time pressure as the primary goal is to exercise and stretch my brain. The secondary goal is to learn something new and for some reason I have picked the Go Language. Finally having an editor that does just what I need it to do with no fluff would be great. Also at the end I will release the code on Git to give back to community. Someone who uses Hugo or Jekyl system might find it useful.\nDay 1 Cleared space, put some music on and start to read. No programming today, just reading. Will be trying to read for 2 hours. Got a notebook and pencil for making notes. Hope this book is not too dry.\n The book I am using is \u0026ldquo;The Go Programming Language\u0026rdquo; by Alan Donovon and Brian Kernighan, published by Addison-Wesley.\n *** Update\nWell day one did not go well. I think that less than 2 hours sleep is not a great place to start from. Still managed to read the first 2 chapters. Deep breath and will do better today.\nDay 2 A better day studying today. Got through the first 2 chapters again and this time understood the examples and was able to modify them to do different things. Also got my head around the basics of error handling. Managed to skim over the next 2 chapters which I will read tomorrow. The idea is to take each step and if I feel like I donât have a solid handle on the chapter and the methods then I stop and will redo the next day. Only computer time was trying the examples and modifying them. Feel positive about what I have achieved.\nThe programming mindset is starting to return to me a bit. As if the ability to concentrate. Baby steps in rebuilding my baby soul and brain.\nDay 3 - 7 This week is all of sudden reduced to skimming over chapters and checking out some documentation on the Go Language site. Tam has to be home and my time looking at Go will be as and when he lets me pick up a book or use an tablet to read a website. So for now more next week. Progress is slow but I do feel that I am getting a slow understanding of the basics. Lets see what the next few days bring.\n",

It feels like the hole she has left in our life ha got bigger not smaller. We keep wrapping an eggshell around the hole she left with a mixture of things we have done, memories we are building but then it cracks. I donât think this will change. She was one of kind as a partner and as a mother. She is missed more everyday by both Tam and me.\nSo birthdays are still crap but at least we stay standing. I know my tiny little soul just wanted to curl up and cry but I didnât. I was busy at hospital instead. Still did not stop me thinking about her all day.\nHospital was not much fun. Need an op for a frozen shoulder. My right shoulder has about 30% of the function it should have. Not a great situation when looking after Tam as he can be unpredictable and he is very strong for his size and age. I have had to come up with all sorts of new techniques to keep him calm but I have also stopped doing certain things with him. I am on the waiting list for the op so all I can do is keep going with the things I am doing.\nSo, Tams birthday and I have already got loads of things for him. Mostly small pressies that I know he will have fun with. He gets spoiled all year long so I do what I can to make his day the best I can. Still leaves me with an empty feeling that Bev is not here to enjoy it and spoil him as well. I know Tam will be missing Mammy and if itâs anything like last year we will have a lot of tears and asking about Mammy. Part of the process I guess.\nSchool. Tam had a short week and a full week at school. It has gone much better than I was hoping for. In January and February he was having a hard time and I had lost confidence in the school. I was getting reports of Tam having a good day but finding ripped T-shirtâs in his bag with no explanation. After 8 days of a new year I feel like we are back to having great communication and Tam is working well at school. I actually think it has been much harder on me than on him. I had got used to home schooling him and the idea of repeating the situation in January and February was not one I needed or wanted. I did not want to put Tam through that again. The one thing I know about Tam is that he will do what he wants and that will generally be a surprise. So well done my beautiful son, you have made mammy and daddy very proud. Keep it up son.\nThe next week is going to be tough. Finger crossed for Tam to continue with good behaviour and liking school first. Then I have a few personal things to sort out that I need to get done. I also need to get my tiny brain motivated in doing something that wakes it up and finally I hope to get results from X-ray and blood work from the doctor. All of this is anxiety inducing.\nSo onwards to Tams birthday. We will make it the best of the day we can and at least have cake and ice cream together.\nStay safe\nAlan \u0026amp; Tam\n",

The major drawback is brain antrophy.\nWith Tams behaviour being unpredictable I cannot work in the normal sense of having a 9-5 job. If something happens to Tam then I have to move and move quickly. It does not matter if he is at school, respite or at home, things change too fast for Tam and I have to be there for him. At a minimum you could call Tam complex without grief and PTSD of losing him Mammy. So I need to find as many tools to learn to place in my arsenal that are saleable.\nNow I can knock together a website, trouble shoot complex network systems, break systems to find weaknesses and a bit of programming, but I need something that stretches my brain. A new direction that will benefit my mental health and possibly give me a different source for income. Now programmers reading this are giving themselves a facepalm slap. They don\u0026rsquo;t see how programming is going to help someones mental health. Well all I will cay is that I love solving problems, learning something new and my brain is ridicuosly analytical. So programming for mental health here we go.\nAn the tiny tiny little pun at the end of the last paragraph is that after looking around the many computer languages I have decided on the Go language. The intention is to write a few things to help me and Tam on the computer as part of the learning process. I did look at the Flutter framework which uses Dart and meant I could write things for use on Tams tablet computers but I decided that our time on the computer is more distraction free and productive so Go Landuage it is.\nI will be documenting this in a series of posts, each spanning a week. I will also set up a GitHub repository and post any interesting code or examples that I have found useful. This might not succeed and my tiny little brain might not grasp the fundamentals never mind the more complex side of programming in modern languages but here we GO.\n",

    "body": "Bad start Over my adult life I have pretty much had a camera all of the time. Canon, Nikon, Olympus, Sony all kinds of cameras. I have used them for my own personal interests and also for work. I have always enjoyed photography and having the wonderful time of watching Tam grow up and the love he had for his mammy was great subject matter.\nWhen Bev died photography became horrible. I did not see the point. I got rid of my camera and everything photography related. I could not see the point at all.\nStarting again Over time as the hole in our lives got bigger and Tam was growing so fast I felt like I was letting Tam and myself down. I started taking photos of Tam again with my phone. I started to show Tam photos of him and Mammy. We did a photo wall together. None of this filled or reduced the size of the loss we had but it started to wrap around the darkness.\nTam started to take interest in more and more photos and also would ask me to explain the story of photos by pressing my throat with his fingers. He would sit quiet looking at the picture with me while I told him all about the day it was taken and what we were doing. It was and is precious time together.\nSo with a bit of pressure from friends I got a new camera. There is something about having a camera in my hand that is designed just for the purpose of taking photos. It does nothing else. It will not interupt you, in fact it will force you to slow down and contemplate what you are doing and what you are seeing. For me it is very theraputic.\nWhile Tam was at school I would go out for a walk and take photos of people, landscapes, cityscapes, anything that caught my eye. It allowed me to slow down, quiet my brain and try to organise my thoughts. Plus Tam is great to photograph. As soon as I pick the camera up he says \u0026ldquo;cheese\u0026rdquo;.\nTam gets interested Over time I started to take the camera everywhere. Tam was always willing to be in front of the lens and now he was starting to take interest in looking throught the lens. Over time I was getting Tam to take more and more photos. When we got home he would be straight on the computer and asking me to load the photos.\n Photography - the process of catching light at a particular tiny snapshot of time and changing the context by removing everything from outside the frame.\n This was turning into a double headed win. Tam being quiet and methodical while taking the photo and then having a peaceful time looking through photos together. Real quality time together.\n",

Each event that happens that she does not witness and be part of with us makes it a lesser event.\nTam going back to school for a new year was full of excitement with Bev. She made such a fuss of Tam and I don\u0026rsquo;t know how she did it. I cannot work out the Mummy thing she did. All I can do is the Dad thing for Tam and for that I feel like I am failing Tam. I have to keep reminding myself that life is cruel and we have to make the best of it.\nWell babe, you would be so proud of our son right now. He has been to Bedburn for a couple of nights and had fun. He came back so loving and full of giggles. He needed a rest from Dad after six months of being in each others pockets. His first day back at school has went well. So bloody proud of him. Sleep is still strange with Tam. He is a nocturnal boy. He definitely has a different circadian rhythm.\nHappy Birthday babe, miss you more everyday and love you more everyday.\nAlan \u0026amp; Tam\nPS. We are still feeding the crows.

At 2am he wanted to get ready and go to school. I was relieved but had to explain it was 6 hours to go. Tam has zero, absolutely zero patience so that was not easy. Then at 8am when I tried to get him ready all I got was \u0026ldquo;NO\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;stay at home with dad\u0026rdquo;. Oh hell.\nA very patient talk with Tam and a weak daddy voice and we got ready. Packed his day pack and off we went. I was playing his current favourite YouTube video for him as bribery (the best parenting tool) and he got the in the taxi and went off giggling. Phew. Now just wait to find out what type of day he has.\n   That\u0026rsquo;s Tams favourite video at the moment. He giggles so hard and shouts \u0026ldquo;baby, doggy\u0026rdquo;. I have no idea why it tickles him so much either.\nI have to get busy. Not think.\n*** Update ***\nTam had an excellent day. YYYYYYEEEEEEESSSSSSS. Never mind COVID-19, my boy enjoyed school.

He was kicking scratching and biting me on a night once he realised he was going to school the next day. He was fighting in the morning getting ready and this continued getting him into the taxi. He was coming home with ripped tshirts. And now after 6 months of home schooling I have to send him back. This feels so wrong.\nDuring the 6 months of no school I have home schooled him. Even when we have been nocturnal. Every day, 7 days a week, we have had a schedule of eating, school, learning, and fun. Tam has done so well and we have both benefited from the schedule. Everyday we put loads of energy into it. I now have to change that to something that worries me a lot.\nMy worries are many, will Tam have issues again and end up putting staff and other kids in jeopardy. Will he catch COVID and be ill. He could bring it home and he could end up being an orphan. Shit all of the worries. Does this really make sense for the kids and the teachers.\nOnce Tam gets used to going back to school, lets say he enjoys it, how will he react to a lockdown again. Change is hard.\nRight, Greenwell. You have written it down. Swallow it. Stand up straight, smile and get on with it. No time for worrying. Got things to do.\nStay Safe\nAlan \u0026amp; Tam\n",

If anything it just gets bigger and bigger. Losing Bev has been the hardest thing to cope with in my life and for Tam it has been even more devastating.\nMemories of her are everywhere.\nTam is in the process of getting used to going back to school. I am also wondering if it will happen and the preparation that I am putting into Tam will all be for nothing. I am so tempted to pull Tam out of school and home school him. I have been for the last six months. Anyway 9th September he is going back (at the moment). My fears and anxieties are all based around him being safe. He was not having a good time at school in January and February and if that continues then I feel like the only option I have is to home school him. All I can do is my best to prepare him and see what happens.\nThe day after Tam goes back to school will be Bev\u0026rsquo;s birthday. I would give my own life to have her back for Tam.\nAll in all my anxiety and stress is running high. I am doing my best to mask it from Tam as he feeds on it and it makes things harder from him.

I am stuck with coping with his meltdowns in pain and the pain just gets worse until I can get him calm. Life is just not jiving with me.\nOn a bright note I managed to cut Tams hair. Not easy one handed. It was getting knotted and the more worrying part is that during his meltdowns he was pulling on it hard. I knew I had to do something so when I had a spurt of energy and Tam was in a playful mood we did it. He looks so grown up with it short, plus he has been in a much better mood since he had it cut.

    "body": " Shitty long month - Tam been ill. Lots of bites. Difficult to move forward. Feel like I am in quicksand.\n July has been a rough month. I think it has been rough for everyone. New ways of shopping. Different approaches for work. The new norm is not normal yet. We all have our anxieties and we all have worries and wonderment as to the future. Are we already in the new future or is there more to come?\nTam  Over the past few weeks, something has been up with Tam. He has been triggered so easily to anger it has been unreal. The worst incident happened outside while we were waiting for the bus for him to go on a little respite trip. All of a sudden out of nowhere he started scratching, kicking, and biting. 0-100 in a nanosecond. The worst part was that he was trying to run and we were right near to a major road.\nTam was full ongoing between biting and trying to run. It was 10 minutes of painful hell. Then when the bus came he went off with Wendy and Joan crying and me left sitting in the middle of the pavement.\nIt was not something I have seen from Tam for a while and it was probably the worst event we had had. Why did it happen? What caused him to act this way?\nWell after a few calls to the doctor and a bad few days the Doc gave him a check-up. His ears were inflamed. Could that be the reason? I know when I have inflamed or blocked ears I don\u0026rsquo;t feel great and I get irritable. So the only thing to do was to treat it with antibiotics (sorry Mam) and see what happens.\nA few days of antibiotics and Tam has gone back to himself. No more anger. No more lashing out. Another thing to add to the list of checks to make to ensure he is healthy and happy.\nMe \u0026ndash;\nOver the past few years, I have at times been a little reckless in takes knocks in an effort to protect Tam. This recklessness has come back to haunt me. I have a bad shoulder. It originally showed itself as pain when I was going to sleep and it was bad enough that it would wake me.\nAfter the incident with Tam, it got a lot worse and I felt like I had lost about 60% of my strength and ability in my right shoulder. Sudden stabs of pain when I was just picking up a cup, or washing the dishes that make me clench my teeth.\nThank god we have Tam calm again as it would have got a lot worse not being able to contain him.\nShopping  Tam used to like the process of going shopping as long as he could have the things he liked. That included a visit to HMV to have a rummage around and also a trip to Starbucks for a bacon sandwich and cookie. It was a mostly relaxing time for me as well. Now those things are not available our shopping trips are rapid and well planned. I organise the trip, explain it to Tam, and when we get to the shops if things are taking a bit too long I give Tam my phone for a quick YouTube fix. It keeps him calm and takes my mind off things.\nNow all of that is well and good but we have a new phenomem. The interfering busybody who feels empowered to question a little boy over not having a mask on properly. Some have even told me I should have a mask on in the moment I have lowered it to show Tam a smile and a word of reassurance. Now I am not saying that I have been a total gentleman in my responses to these people (to be honest my Mam and Dad would be ashamed) but I have been restrained with most of these interfering busybodies. Sometimes I will admit that I have been downright rude and once I even swore at the person (I have never believed that if you swear you have lost the arguement). Well lets come clean I actually made a 30ish year old lad cry after berating for thinking he had been given the right to police anyone. Confession over.\nI usually come away from these shitty encounters shaking with anger and worried about Tam even more than before we got the shops. Why don\u0026rsquo;t these people just stay at home? They are as bad as the idiots that intentionally go into stores without a mask on to antagonise people. They are just attention seekers.\nOK OK Rant over.\nSchooling  So its the school holidays. 6 weeks of having Tam home. Hang on for just a second. He\u0026rsquo;s been home since early March. 5 months, 5 months, and another 6 weeks before school again.\nWhoa, hang on. 6 weeks is a long time for 2020 to come up with some new story arc or a twist to the plot line. A lot can happen yet. Lets worry about school when they actually open the doors.\nIf only it was as simple as that.\nSeptember is birthday month, Bevs, mine then Tams. That with Tam potentially going back to school and all that that entails. Oh I am not looking forward to that.\nI have to take into consideration the problems Tam was having at school in January and February. I lost count of the number of uniform tops that Tam destroyed. Not looking forward to him returning without a lot of planning.\nOh and I just thought, Tam, is now 5 foot 4 inches. He has grown a lot since March, I doubt that any uniform will fit him.\n2020, what has it got left in store for us all. I don\u0026rsquo;t know and I doubt that any wild ideas would cover what the next few months bring.\nSo in the meantime stay safe.\nAlan \u0026amp; Tam\n",

The shopping is the hardest part as with a bad shoulder it is limiting what I can carry. Even taking that into consideration I have one more worry.\nIn some ways it\u0026rsquo;s a strange worry but it\u0026rsquo;s a worry all the same. What\u0026rsquo;s the worry? Well it\u0026rsquo;s the pubs open on Saturday. I don\u0026rsquo;t drink so why is it a worry?

Before we even got home he was asking about the photos on the memory wall. At home he points at the photo and I tell him the story of when the photo was taken. An hour or after we got home he sat down at the computer and asked \u0026ldquo;more photos\u0026rdquo;. He had a quiet 30 minutes or so looking at photos and sometimes asking me about the photos. Not all were his Mammy, but a lot were.\nSince we had that time with the photos things have gone downhill. Tam has become angry and is lashing out. It started late in the evening and went on all night. I have had to take his beloved TV remote off him because he was biting it so hard. Also his iPad has gone the distance because he banged his hands on it. He has been flipping between a lovely boy wanting tickles and cuddles to being really violent.\nWith no respite available I am using all of the techniques for keeping Tam calm and content that I have. A lot of times I am able to talk him down but a couple of times my fingers have taken the brunt end of his frustrations. He is so quick.\nI hate been wary of my own boy. I hate holding back so it means that sometimes a cuddle in the moment of anger and crying ends up with a few scratches or a bite so be it. Part of parenthood.\nWe are still living a nocturnal life. Ask me to my face and I will say \u0026ldquo;as long Tam is happy it is fine\u0026rdquo;. Well, secretly it is getting a bit difficult now.

With the biggest thing to achieve is to get Tam back in the routine of getting ready and going to school.\nLast night was a bad night until somehow we clicked and Tam slept. It happened about 1am in the morning but it happened. It was a major relief that he actually slept. How did this miracle come about?\nI had put Tam to bed with the hope that he would sleep after 3 bad days. That was not happening, he was bouncing around and trying to get out of bed. We tried all of the normal things and in the end I broke down and explained why Daddy was upset. \u0026ldquo;You have 2 more sleeps and then you go to school, I don\u0026rsquo;t want you going to school tired and grumpy\u0026rdquo;.

I cried in relief that my little boy who has been through so much listened and was on his way to sleep. 5 minutes and he was snoring.\nI got out of bed and had a cup of tea and calmed down. Then I slept.\nHe woke up at 10 am. Rested and in a lovely mood.\nTwo more sleeps left and back into the routine he likes so much.\nUpdate Well the second last sleep did not go well.

Still holding my hand tightly. It was 5 am and my beautiful boy was asleep and peaceful. I could only hope that he had the sweetest of dreams.\nI woke him at 11 am. I knew that I should wake him earlier but did not have the heart to disturb his sleep. I know that the amount he sleep and his physical health are linked. I will just have to see what happens tonight.\nOne sleep left.\nLooking back After 6 weeks of dealing with all kinds of events and set backs I think the thing that I have learned is that Tam loves the routine of school. At home its a different matter. He likes to be a bit more spontaneous. I think deciding to do something like go shopping is best done with a simple statement and countdown process. Trying to plan things just raises the anxiety in Tam, or it raises it in me and Tam feeds off it. I need to work that part out and make things work better for both of us. We both need to relax more I think.\nOf all of the trips that I had planned with Tam I think only the short trips have worked. I know that the York, Edinburgh and Lakes trips have all not worked. A couple of hundred pounds of train tickets not used. I have to just put them down to part of the discovery process of single parenting.\n",

    "body": "So, we have 3 more weeks of lock down.\nIts 5:50am on Friday morning and we are still up. We got up at 6pm yesterday. Tam is relaxed and sitting next to me. We have a delivery from Morrisons in 5 hours which includes all of Tams favourite foods. Yesterday I talked to the Doc about my meds and also to Tams respite centre about how they help. Both of those conversations made me feel better.\nMy health app is showing that over the past week I have averaged just over 8 hours of sleep per day. So that\u0026rsquo;s a positive, the downside of that is that it looks like I have been doing cover shifts. The 8 hours of sleep per day have occurred at different times of the day. Its a bit weird and at times is hard to deal with but at least both me and Tam are getting sleep.\nFood has been a bit more of a problem. Tam likes specific things, a good example is the wholewheat noodles that he likes. They are wound in a circular nest and are brown. Another make of wholewheat noodles look exactly the same colour and profile but are made as a wrinkled bed. So in the raw they look the same on the basis of colour and profile but are packaged differently. Tam knows this. However, if I cook the round nested ones with out him seeing he will eat them no problem. If I cook the wrinkled bed ones, again without him seeing, he will turn his nose up and refuse them. I cannot tell the difference in smell, taste or look once cooked. Tam can. So, the point is a seemingly harmless substitution can impact the ease in keep Tam fed and happy.\nTaking Tam out to the shops as I have mentioned before is full of problems of him touching things and then stimming and touching his face, or having stupid busy bodies wanting to have there thoughtless say. It also triggers Tam into thinking we can do other things like go to the cinema. It breaks my heart not being able to take him to the cinema. He gets so excited asking about going to the cinema. How can I explain that we cannot go so that he understands? I know where we will be as soon as the cinema reopens.\n3 more weeks of lockdown.\n",

    "body": "\u0026ldquo;May you live in interesting times\u0026rdquo; - A curse (proven not to be a chinese saying)\nWell, these are interesting times and not in a good way. The curse is active and visiting us every day and every hour at the moment. Give me the good old days of loads of people on the street and the car parks being full.\nI have tried a few times over the last few days to write something. Each time I have either come up blank or it\u0026rsquo;s been dark. The lockdown has made things more difficult in many ways. It is a struggle to keep the stocks of the right foods for Tam. It feels wrong taking Tam out to pick up food but I have no option. I hate being out with Tam at the moment because he picks up on the strange atmosphere and the strange behaviour.\nLast time we went out to the local shop I managed to keep Tam chilled right up to the point I had to ask someone to move. They had stood in the same spot for a full five minutes on their phone texting or something. They were not taking any notice of what was going on around them and should not have been there. I asked him to move and pointed out that he had been standing in the same place for 5 minutes and other people were waiting to come in the store and he just said \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t care a toss about other people\u0026rdquo;, the worst of humanity. I later saw him arguing with the staff after trying to buy loads of Easter eggs. I am disgusted that stores are even stocking Easter eggs. For fuck\u0026rsquo;s sake the space on the truck could have carried another loaf of bread or something more useful. Easter eggs are not needed right now and anyone who wants to buy easter eggs needs to have a long and serious look at themselves. Waste of money at the best of times, a criminal waste of resources and space right now.\nThere we go, me getting dark. I have always hated selfish people and this is just proving the point. In the news, we hear about loads of self-centred and selfish people that think the rules are for other people. We hear and see people buying as much as they can just to throw it away a week later when it goes off. Society needs to look at its self in the mirror, it\u0026rsquo;s not a pretty reflection.\nSo for a large part of the time, I don\u0026rsquo;t feel I have much to write about. My time is all about keeping me and Tam safe and happy. Tam being happy is all I need. We are taking each day, following our little schedule and doing what we need to do.\nOnce we get through this and come out of the other side I will get back to writing more, but for now, it will be sporadic.\nStay safe and stay home\nAlan \u0026amp; Tam\n",

    "body": "Nocturnal life is common amongst geeks. I have stayed upÂ until the early hours and then got up at 6am and headed off to work, with a couple of hours of sleep. As I have got older, I have become less and less able to do it. Now, as a single parent of Tam, I have had to learn how to do it again.Â If I am working on the computers Tam will happily sit with me either on the sofa if I am working on the laptop or on my knee if I am working on the desktop computer and watch and listen to my explanations of what we are doing. He is so intensely interested and if we have a lull in the activity; I have to find another job to fill in the time. At night, when the world is quiet and all the sensory inputs haveÂ we have turned the sensory inputs right down, it settles Tam. When his sensory inputs are my voice and the clack-clack of the keyboard, he is super chilled and immersed in what is going on. If I have to have a video conference, he will sit still and quiet, watching the screen and listening to the conversation. If I am using headphone, he likes to press his head againstÂ one headphone so he can hear both sides. It is a lovely calm time for both of us. It\u0026rsquo;s our non-anxious time. The rest of the world does not matter, and COVID-19 does not exist. Our escape.\nTam has just got up from sitting with me and pulled the blinds up. He did that yesterday at exactly the same time 5:12am. Today the cloud obscure the peachy glow in the sky that we had yesterday. (how do I know the time he pulled the blinds up yesterday, well I checked the time we took a photo yesterday)\nAfter a bad day yesterday where anxiety, depression and grief overtook me and Tam fed off it tonight has been a much better time. Tam has had moments of being an absolute tinker. He has put his puppy eyes to great use asking for food, and also he has been so loving. He has really cheered me up.Â The sky is a purply blue grey and the clouds are heading south. The day is just starting for most; we are well into it. Today we will get fresh air and try to power on and get to normal sleep time. If we fail, then so what. As long as I have a happy boy and we get our to doâs done for the day then we will have a successful day. Right now we have cleared all but two tasks off our list. Getting some exercise and fresh air is the only one that matters and to be honest it is a great time to go for a walk as I donât think we will see a person.

    "body": "The last few days have seen us doing homeschooling, building and rebuilding our fort, tidying, reorganising DVD\u0026rsquo;s, and finally going out shopping. It has been a time fraught with anxiety. It has been a peculiar time and will no doubt continue to be weird.\nTam is very chilled and although he has his moments he is much more relaxed. That is down to the fact that he is not going to school. He mentions it now and again and I explain \u0026ldquo;no school\u0026rdquo; and from that point on he is chilled. A win for now but when he goes back to school I am expecting a huge backlash. I hope I am wrong.\nAnxiety has been the biggest problem I have been dealing with. A lot of that anxiety has been around feeding Tam and having the things that he asks for and the things I know he will eat. We have managed to get 1 delivery so far. Got the next one in a couple of days and then the last one we have booked is about 10 days after. I keep checking for more delivery slots but it is coming up blank. I worry that if the local shops close then getting food is going to get difficult.\nThe other part of the anxiety is about getting sick. If either of us gets sick how will it work? What will happen? Both me and Tam have had coughs, Tam has been off his food and had a few days of on and off low fever. But with that said I don\u0026rsquo;t know if we have had COVID-19 or not. I wish I had a couple of antibody tests.\nSome things I have stopped worrying about are sleep and time. Tam after being ill has fallen into a strange set of sleep patterns which I have not stressed about. I am slowly working on getting him back to normal times of sleep but for now, it does not matter. We have no visitors, we have nowhere to be so right now it is more important for Tam to be chilled and happy. I sleep when he sleeps, I eat when he eats, we chill.\nI am writing this and Tam is sitting at one end of the sofa with his feet up watching \u0026ldquo;The Fantastic Voyage\u0026rdquo;, yes the 1960\u0026rsquo;s film. He is immersed. He has just pulled the blinds up as the sun is coming up, its a lovely peachy colour and just a little misty. We have done some maths and English. We have extended our mantras of question and answers. Food has been fine and a little too much coffee has been drunk by me. For all I have had enough hours of sleep I still find being awake from 4-5am a tough time. I always have for some reason.\nI am not expecting school to restart until 2021, I might be wrong but for the moment there are too many unknowns so it is better for my brain to see this as a bunch of marathons rather than a sprint to easter and then school will be bake on. I doubt very much that anything will change after easter.\nSummary, we have forgotten about time and we operate to Tams internal clock with my Daddy modifications to bring it some reality and alignment with the outside world. Tam is happy and secure is still the most important aspect of life. The bites and scratches are nearly all healed from the school fear incidents. Anxiety level is much higher than normal and is something I am working on. I am getting a bit tired of making bacon, mushroom and noodles; but I am trying to widen Tams food likes. We are getting plenty of exercise because we have loads of time for rough and tumble. Outside time is all about doing as much as we can and make the time productive.\nIts 5:49am and Tam is starting to get sleepy again, Fantastic Voyage is coming to an end and hopefully he will want to go to bed and sleep when the credits have rolled. Stay safe and sleep well.\nAlan \u0026amp; Tam\n",

Right now a good nights sleep is important. It helps to revitalise the immune system. I had a night of broken sleep with bad dreams and flashbacks. A reminder of how life can change so fast. This is going to be a long haul and that has a lot of worries attached. A night of bad dreams and flashbacks is understandable. My tiny little soul is trying to work things out and I need my tiny little baby soul to man up. I need a rugged battling hard arsed soul right now and I think he is cowering in the corner. I feel a bit like Bruce Banner when the Hulk refused to come out.\nThings right now are crazy (I nearly said a bit crazy, well this is full on crazy) and there is a lot of uncertainity and anxiety surrounding all of us. I think my biggest worry right now is having enough deep dish pizzas and bacon, mushroom and noodles for Tam. I can get by on most anything but my boy is a fussy eater.\nThe second worry is if one of us gets really sick. At the moment I still don\u0026rsquo;t know if Tam had COVID-19 or just cold/flu. I have no clue. But there is a thousand ways to get real sick and what would happen in any of those situations.\nOK, Greenwell, step back from yourself, take your tablets have a cup of tea.\n9PM The bean bag came earlier today and Tam loves it. He has found about 10 ways to use it and at one point threw it at me. So that is a big win. I was a bit disappointed by the size of it but Tam isn\u0026rsquo;t so no problem. We had our run out, so some exercise today.\nAlso watched the annoucement at 5. Things have got very real for people, the pubs are closed as well as every venue for entertainment. I forsee a large increase in divorces when this is all over.\nI am expecting that binge shopping will now move to alcohol which I am OK with as I don\u0026rsquo;t drink,\nWell that feels like a ramble for today, but it is what it is.\nStay Safe\nAlan \u0026amp; Tam\n",

No temperature for now, just a lad who is glad to be home and lying on the sofa watching a cowboy movie. He loves the old movies.\nI am feeling a bit achy but that does not feel like anything new. The good nights sleep was much appreciated this morning. It was nice sitting with the quiet around us having a cup of coffee and not feeling like crap. Sleep is good.\nToday we are going for an isolation walk. A bit of exercise. It looks real quiet outside so we will pick our moment and have an hours walk around the park. Might even take the camera. I think the thing to remember is isolation and social distancing are the same think. It is OK to get some exercise just respect the distance. End of public service announcement.\n10:30pm Well we never made it out. We did stick to our regime of a structured day, eating, film, classroom time, tickle time, tidy time. All done together, essential to our sanity.\nTam is coming out of his cold/flu or whatever it has been. Still not sure.

A throw back to simpler times and when dialogue in films was given time to breathe. Easy to watch.\nA laptop tray. It is multi functional and serves as a base for hobbies, eating and putting your warm laptop on as you binge watch all of the Netflix/Prime/Disney stuff you have not had time for.\nFood Setup several deliveries from your favourite grocery store. Space them out and don\u0026rsquo;t go crazy. Don\u0026rsquo;t binge buy. Think ahead instead. If you have a delivery coming a couple of times a week with what you need then things will be fine if you stick to the normal amounts. Oh and don\u0026rsquo;t forget to put some luxuries in. A simple bar of nice chocolate or sachets of a hot drink for a change will make life in isolation much more pleasent.\nSocial Reach out with phone calls or video calls to people you have lost touch with or haven\u0026rsquo;t spoke to for a while. Don\u0026rsquo;t be apologetic, just say you where wondering how they were doing and now time was available and the world has gone crazy you just wanted them to know you were thinking about them. Ask them what they have been up to. It\u0026rsquo;s nice. Try it.\nSaying thanks Delivery people. Give them a small tip, a couple of pounds as a thank you. They are in the thick of it. Say thank you, and wish them well. I had a laugh with my delivery person as I was wiping a few pound coins with an alcohol wipe and handing them to him from the wipe. We both laughed. Crazy world. Be thoughful, practice saying thanks more.\nKeep busy Start a hobby, restart a hobby, do an online course. Keep busy. Use the time wisely. When we all come out of this you will know something new and feel good about it.\nAll of these things will help. Me and Tam have started how we mean to go on.

    "body": "Tam has been a sweaty boy during the night. Asking for ice cubes and drinking lots. Checked his temp and it appears \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo;. For the most part he is behaving like he has a cold, just this time it is lasting more than a day. Normally when he gets a cold he just wants to sleep it off and that lasts a day. This is turning out to be a little different. He still has a tickly cough but it comes and goes.\n10am on Wednesday and after a very broken nights sleep Tam is still in bed and fast asleep. Breathing is fine, temperature is \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo;, so for now I will let him sleep. His nest is made ready for when he gets up.\nFor my mental health I have deleted all of the news apps on my phone. I am largely staying off news sites on the web and spending more time being busy with other things. I think keeping busy right now is important.\nSo apart from writing updates I am doing some web development and rebuilding my computer. Both good tasks to keep my mind active and off the craziness.\n12:28 Tam is up and sitting beside me with his feet up. He\u0026rsquo;s a little warm and cuddling my arm as I type. Just before all of this we got a pack of DVDs that are science fiction classics. Right now Tam is transfixed by \u0026ldquo;The day the earth stood still\u0026rdquo;, the 1951 classic, not the one with Keanu Reeves. So all is chilled (so to speak) and he is comfortable and safe, and I am chilled.\nOn the first full day of isolation I would say the most important things that anyone can do is to keep busy, find some great films to watch (old classics are great) and cut down reading the news and social media. The news and social media is full of sensational crap that largly are sound bites and click bate that is just noise. Better to cut out the anxiety inducing crap and ignore the stupidity of it all. What happens in your home is far more important that what is happening outside. As long as everyone in your home is safe and being looked after all the noise in the media is pointless and disruptive to our lives.\nMore later from the house of Greenwell.\n",

    "body": "Yesterday Tam was getting back to normal. This morning he woke with a cough. It was not the usual cough but enough of a cough to be a worry. It went on for a couple of hours and was joined with a couple of sneezes and some sniffling. Temperature was OK but with Tam temperature is never a good indicator. He seems to have a standard temperature of 36C.\nAfter a few hours of cough my anxiety was getting the better of me. Heart rate flying, fight or flight running rampant and closing in on a bad panic attack. I rang the doctor. After a phone call which settled me it was decided that for all the symptons where not a full match for COVID-19 but it would be better to self isolate.\nIn a way this makes life more difficult and easier in different ways. One thing I will not be able to do is go shopping while Tam is at school for perishables etc. I will half to sort out deliveries for that. The other thing is that now it is settled and Tam is at home I don\u0026rsquo;t have to deal with his angry outbursts of him going to school.\nOnly thing to do now is to get into a positive state of mind and act likes its summer holidays with some restrictions. In my mind I am not expecting the schools to be open in a week and then for them not to open until after easter. So this is the summer holidays winter/spring edition. Yes restrictions are present but we can work our way around that.\nI think my only worry is getting enough food delivered. I have one delivery booked already for Monday and enough to keep us going other than perishables, which are Tams favourites, mushrooms, berries and bananas. Hmm, will have to cheat on them for now, got some tinned mushrooms and berries.\nEntertaining Tam and myself will be easy for now.

I can normally tell by the smell but this time I think it was half and half. Let\u0026rsquo;s put it this way, I cannot send him to school.\nSo 48 hours off school. If it goes according to other times, Tam will be quiet most of the day and then come to life about 3-4 pm. I kind of hope that it will play out exactly like that rather than any other way.\nPart of it I know has been some of my anxiety feeding Tam. I had a bit of a day on Saturday when the grief monster grabbed me by the shoulders and threw me to the floor. My baby soul was crushed again. I know he picked up on that because he was very cuddly and kept taking me to the coffee machine. Bless my beautiful boy.\nSaturday night was weird as Tam did not want to sleep and was just wanting to play. So we played until he asked to go to bed and my baby soul learnt to walk again. We had a nice lie in.\nHere we are the whole world seems to have gone mad with COVID-19 panic buying. No Calpol in any of the pharmicies in Newcastle. Tam favourite foods are all perishable and 48 hours of trying to keep him fed and watered. At some point we will have to go out and do some shopping, but we will cross that bridge when we need to.\nNow part of writing this is to draw attention to what every parent of special education needs kids will be thinking about or going through. The anxiety attached to any illness is high for any parent is high enough, but as I have written before, with a non verbal child or a child with multiple health difficulties the anxiety becomes all consuming. The worry is constant and never ending.\nCOVID-19 is just another one of those worries. It\u0026rsquo;s just an amplified worry.\nSo to all of the families out there with children with complicated lives and medical situations try to be calm, be strong, and above all stay safe.\n",

I have wrote about how not having the ability to communicate with him or understand the reactions he has to pain makes it difficult to decipher what is going on with him. For Petes sake he once ran into a bed end with such force and all he did was giggle. No crying, just giggling. He had a huge bruise and a big lump. Thankfully no break. The hours of confusion that day because my little lad was just giggling after banging his leg.\nThe current world situation is being hyped up by the press (to a degree). Covid-19 is new and science is learning as fast as it can from the case. Yes, its a bit concerning for the wider population and particularily for the older population but for most people it will be a 7-14 day inconvience. Unless of course it changes radically (picture me standing on the fence with that statement).\nI have read the advice (struggling with advice and advise again) put out by the government and NHS and its sensible advice that we should follow. My problem right now is keeping Tam safe. Part of the advice is to wash your hand for 20 seconds, tick, Tam hates dirty hands. Next part, don\u0026rsquo;t touch you face and eyes, no chance. Tam when he stims rubs his eyes, covers his face and generally cannot help himself or be stopped from doing it.\nLast night, to try to break the crazy sleep patterns he has fallen into, we went to the pictures. It was very quiet, not many people there. Only one other family in the screen with us. We went to see Pixars Onward. All good, Tam excited and following his routine for going to the pictures. Buy the tickets, cake at Starbucks, tiolet, find the screen, compare the ticket to the screen, find our seats and settle down. All the time I am wiping his hands and he is touching everything. Half way through the film it all becomes too much and Tam is building to a meltdown and he asks to leave (very proud that he asked to leave and regulate himself). He is stimming quite heavily and covering his face and rubbing his eyes. After a few minutes of being outside the screen he decides he wants Pizza Hut and we don\u0026rsquo;t go back into the movie and head off for something to eat. He calms down.\nStop me I am prattling on.\nThe point of this post is that for all I think that the press is hyping things up to a fever pitch it is still concerning. Yes, it\u0026rsquo;s concerning. I am certainly concerned. We lost Bev very quickly from the effects of flu and the rapid changes it can bring on in someone who would have been described as healthy. Tam saw all that happen. What happens if I get Covid-19, who would look after Tam? What can I do to keep Tam safe from it?\nWell the answer unfortunately is \u0026ldquo;what will be will be\u0026rdquo;. All the effort in the world will not change things. I cannot stop Tam touching his face. He needs to go to school I need to do things and if we get to lock down then we will just cope. \u0026ldquo;Just cope\u0026rdquo; by the way means we will make the best of it, not that we will teeter on the edge of not coping.\nStay safe, keep washing your hands and stop bloody touching your face. Look I said stop touching your face! There you go again, touching your face, stop it.\nStay safe out there\nAlan \u0026amp; Tam\n",

So at 6pm he was asleep and stayed that way until midnight. Kinda what I expected.\nFrom midnight til 4am Tam is awake and wanting to play. When he is in that kind of mood he is hard to contain, but we have developed a game to make it easier. About 4am he started to quiet down and it is at that point I left him by himself with a request to \u0026ldquo;sleep please\u0026rdquo;. Twenty minutes later he was asleep.\nFor me the night continues. If I go to sleep now I will sleep through the alarm even if I connected to a bomb under me. Since midnight I have been pottering around, going through paperwork, washing dishes, getting the washing into the washing machine ready for a \u0026ldquo;decent time\u0026rdquo;. And writing.

Wednesday ended up with Tam being really upset and violent asking about school. Thursday night was even worse, lots of biting, scratching and kicking and it went on for a while.

I immediately told him \u0026ldquo;no school tomorrow\u0026rdquo; and he stopped and cried. For over half and hour he cried and wanted cuddles.\nNow, a few hours later, and Tam is totally chilled. Sitting with his legs over mine and watching me type while we have Peter Rabbit on TV and Marvels Avengers playing on Tam\u0026rsquo;s tablet.\nI think it is easy to see why I kept coming back to something bad happened at school. I now have to look at this as separation anxiety. This is going to be a long road with no easy shortcuts.\nAlan \u0026amp; Tam\n",

    "date": "",
    "description": "",
    "body": "I am going to start off by saying I am nothing special. I am a dad nothing more nothing less. My brain is analytical, it\u0026rsquo;s good at pattern matching and fire fighting. Give me a bad IT situation and I will find a way to get it back to a good situation. I know I have faults, some major faults and I work on them every day.\nSo what has worked in helping Tam and myself to stay standing and progress to a better place. To be honest not much. We are very much a work in progress and the thing that keeps us going is the thought that we are making Bev proud and our love for each other. Not very much but probably the most powerful things that we have non the less.\nJournal Well if I had to advise someone in a similar situation I would recommend strongly to keep a personal journal and keep it personal. Be brutal and truthful in what they write, but also be gentle with themselves. Also us the journal to log behaviours and aspects of life that are worrisome. By doing this it gives you an ability to look back and see changes that have occurred that you would miss otherwise. As a for instance I still put how much Tam sleeps in my journal. It is easy to go back a year and look at the state of play then and compare it to now and realise that things have improved a lot. It is also easy to see that Tam is still going through periods of nightmares and flashbacks in his sleep and that the time between those periods is getting longer. So a journal is probably the most important thing I would recommend. Now saying that I know that writing a journal that is truthful and deciding on the information that it will contain is not easy but I think the payback is worth it. It didn\u0026rsquo;t take long before it was a habit (one of my better habits) and also a place to dump the day. A bad day written down can be forgotten, writing about a good day is cathartic.\nFriends Second. In grief don\u0026rsquo;t worry about \u0026ldquo;friends\u0026rdquo; that run away. Let them go. They are of no use. Your energy is better spent on yourself and the real friends that will let you know they are there. Real friends will listen. Real friends will tell you what\u0026rsquo;s happening in their life to help distract you. Real friends know when to bring food. Real friends will tell you to stop doing something that is negative or unhelpful. Real friends are rare but worth their weight in gold, and that is because they are golden. Oh, by the way, those \u0026ldquo;friends\u0026rdquo; that run away in the early days don\u0026rsquo;t hold it against them. They just don\u0026rsquo;t understand grief and humanity. If they come back around then just hold them gently at arms length. If life takes a bad turn they won\u0026rsquo;t be around so other than a distraction they are pretty useless.\nRoutine Routine is your friend especially in grief. Getting Tam ready for school was the start of my day. It was my focus. I then added cleaning and tidying. This took place first thing after getting Tam to school even if I had not slept the night before. It is much easier to sleep if you know that you will wake to a clean and tidy place. If I did sleep after that I always made the bed. Knowing that you have a clean made bed to slump into when you can get some rest is important. Nothing better than the world going quiet and climbing into a bed with fluffed pillows and sheets ready to pull over yourself.\nAnother aspect of this is if you are having a bad day, knowing that everything was tidy at the start of the day reminds you that it was done that morning and can be done again the next morning. It helps with positivity.\nA part of my routine at times is having alarms set on my phone so that I remember to eat. At times I have so much to do that the thought of food goes out of the window. I have got to 11pm and realised that I have not eaten all day. Tam has had four meals and snacks but I have forgotten about myself. Eat regularly.\nMusic This was hard to begin with. Listen to music even if it makes you cry. Music has a healing power. While you are doing your routine cleaning etc., put some high energy music on to help. It really does help. I have built up some playlists that are routine, my time, sad songs, running, walking, shopping. Each one of the playlists helps in a different way. Some of them have songs that both me and Bev loved and that is part of the healing, listening to our music and not just my music.\nMusic is a healer.\nHonesty At all times through the journey of grief and loss be honest with yourself and the professional around you. If you are honest with yourself well that\u0026rsquo;s a start. Being honest with the health and support professionals will ensure that at least they will try to get you the best help, budgets etc., permitting.\nMy relationship with our GP has been a great help to my physical and mental health. He will tell me what he is thinking and ask what I want to do. If my answer is I don\u0026rsquo;t know then he will explain what we should do. I generally go along with his advice. He always listens to my point of view and will sometimes ask me to think about it before we make changes.\nGrief and loss affects us all in different ways and honesty with those around us and ourselves is the best way forward.\nMe time I am crap at this one. I worry about Tam so much when he is in respite and I have some \u0026ldquo;me time\u0026rdquo;. The last time I was getting horrendous heartburn at bed time. Worried about him sleeping. This is something I have to work on a lot more.\nI know it is important to be kind to myself and if the day starts and my mind or body tells me to stop then I need to listen to it better. Mind body and soul all need to be healthy. Mine are not in line yet, but they are getting on better.\nExercise Before Bev died I did not run. I did not understand people who went running. The last time I went running was at school. Never saw a need for it. I used to ask people who went running \u0026ldquo;what are you running from?\u0026rdquo;. Never got a good answer.\nSo one day I found myself running. I ran for what I found later was about 10 miles. My feet and legs hurt but I could not remember how it started or why. Now every now and again I feel the need to run. The process of running makes my body ache and my mind to go blank. That is as much as I can explain about it. What are I running from? I am running to forget for a moment the loss and worry in my life. I run from loss and worry.\nI also try to make sure I go for a walk everyday. It might be a brisk walk or a stroll, it does not really matter. I might have my headphones in and music or an audiobook playing, I might just be connected to the city drone of sound. It does not really matter, I am out and getting some fresh air and exercise.\nTam time I make sure that everyday that me and Tam have some quality tickle time. He gets so much from it. Just fun interaction with him settles both of us. Its our bonding time, its our silly time. Nothing else matters. Its our time and during that time nothing else matters.\nSo for what it\u0026rsquo;s worth those are the things that have helped me and Tam during our horrible period of the loss of Mammy. We miss her more every day and she is always in our thoughts. The above is our advise for anyone going through the loss of a loved one. You will never be the same after losing them. You will always carry a hole in your heart and soul that cannot be filled. You will just learn to carry that loss with you and wrap new things around you and the loss you have suffered.\nJust remember what Keanu Reeves said when he was asked what happens when people die. He said \u0026ldquo;I know the ones who love us will miss us\u0026rdquo;.\nAlan \u0026amp; Tam\n",

    "body": "Half term is over, respite was a success and the first 2 days at school took place. First day went fine, first night was great. My little lad was full of fun and knackered. He slept well. Second morning went ok but had a lot of tears as I sent him off to school. All however changed tonight.\nTam came home tired again and asked to go to bed early. Like 6pm early and went to sleep. So far so good. I got some sleep not knowing when he would wake. Well he woke at 11pm and was fine and then he changed. Full on attack mode came from nowhere. Biting, kicking, scratching. It took a while to calm him and then the tears came again. Half an hour or so of calmness and suddenly attack mode again. More biting and scratching and worse than the first time.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s now 3am and Tam is quiet in bed but not asleep. So calm and quiet are the current situation with a bit of anxiety about more explosions from Tam and how he will be in the next few hours when he has to go to school. All the explosions tonight have included Tam saying \u0026ldquo;no school\u0026rdquo;. What the hell am I meant to do?\nAll of the feedback from school is that he has had a good day. He\u0026rsquo;s been laughing and smiling, wanting tickles and having a good day doing his work, so why is he so anti-school? It does not make sense.\nWell, it does not make sense until you add separation anxiety into the mix. I have always known that this would be a problem since Bev died. He watched the whole thing unfurl from CPR to being with her at hospital when her body gave up. It would be a problem with a normal kid, it is always being to be more of a problem with an autistic kid.\nOver the past 2 years I have been protective of Tam and I know that I have spoiled him with affection. It was inevitable that I would. Bev would have done the same. To be honest me and Bev were very protective of Tam before and we have always spoiled him. For Tam to lose one of the centres of love and affection was always going to be difficult for him.\nNow the way forward has removed a problem at school from the equation and is focussed almost solely on the separation anxiety. And right now that is not a simple fix. This will take time. It will not be easy and for now I expect this to probably take years before we make good progress. For now it will be a rough road. I will have to moderate my behaviour with Tam and find ways to make him feel more secure when he is away from me.\nSo for tonight it is no sleep. Hopefully Tam will get some more sleep tonight. Then off to school for him and some sleep for me. Then Tam will be home and we try little changes each night until we get some progress which stops Tam from lashing out. Some little change might be all we need. It might not be, but thats where we start.\nSo after a week of hoping that things were changing we are back on the long slog of grief and loss.\nSleep well\nAlan \u0026amp; Tam\n",

    "body": "It\u0026rsquo;s day 3 of Tam being in respite. One more sleep and he is home again.\nI set out plans for this time without Tam and I have mostly failed in achieving them. However, I have managed to reset things in my head and get some rest. I suppose it is better to fail in plans in an effort to work through the other more important things in life.\nA major realisation that I suffer badly from separation anxiety as much as Tam does and its something I have to work on. If I can get a handle on it that will help Tam.\nThings I did get done. I learned something new. In working on a friends website I learned a lot about CSS (a web technology). This give me a nice sense of achievement. Spent a bit of time testing what I have learned and will apply it sometime next week. I tried to learn something very technical to support doing some paying work but my brain would just not accept it.\nI got a lot of tidying up done. At last I got caught up. Did a reorganisation of a few things to make life a little bit easier.\nHad one bad nights sleep and one good nights sleep. The bad nights sleep was flash backs and waking up and panicking when Tam was not here. Stupid but real. A bit of my brain was looking for Bev as well and sleep would not return. The second night I got a bit mad with myself as I tossed and turned and could not settle so I got up and watched some crap TV for half and hour and then tried again. Sleep arrived and so did the morning all too quickly.\nDecided to build a computer that I was going to do later in the week and cracked it out in just over an hour. Brain work is too much, but motor skills are still operating well. Muscle memory is a great thing. Will have to work on building up my concentration .\nTomorrow morning up with the larks and off to get Tam. Home and prep for school. Hopefully he will stay calm at the thought of school.\n Especially at night\nI worry over situations\nI know will be alright\nPerhaps it\u0026rsquo;s just imagination\nDay after day it reappears\nNight after night my heartbeat shows the fear\nGhosts appear and fade away\nMen at work - overkill\n",

    "title": "Grief Monster",
    "date": "",
    "description": "",
    "body": "The grief monster is back again with Tam and his dreams.\nDr. Kubler-Ross listed the stages of grief as shock, denial, anger, bargaining, depression, testing, and acceptance. John Bowlby proposed 4 stages: shock and numbness, yearning and searching, despair and disorganization, reorganization and recovery. Now I think for me I can see the Kubler-Ross as the path I am on and the Bowlby path as the one Tam is on. I think Tam blasted through the shock and numbness and has got stuck on the yearning and searching. To be clear though Tam is not doing grief in anything like a linear way and neither am I. When Tam gets down I get down down.\nLast night I managed to get Tam to bed and everything was good. A nights sleep and a busy day, rinse and repeat. Tam and me being busy and doing things together is a good day.\nLess than an hour of Tam being asleep in bed I heard him screaming for Mammy. So for the second night running I rushed in and tried to settle him back to sleep but he was sobbing and beyond any form of settling. It is something that we have to ride out. After multiple attempts to get him settled and back to bed we called a halt and settled down to some reading. He continued to be upset all night. The tears flowed on and off all night. Yearning and searching seems to be the best description of where Tam is in the grieving process. My main concern is that he does not get stuck there for the rest of his life.\nRecently I heard the best explanation of death. At the end of an interview Stephen Colbert asked Keanu Reeves, \u0026ldquo;What do you think happens when we die?\u0026rdquo; After a pause Keanu replied âI know that the ones who love us will miss us.â Tam shows that to be deeply true. We both miss Bev but it is the depth of loss that Tam has that is heartbreaking.\nAnyway after all of that we have ended up with a repeat performance of yesterday. It 5:03am and Tam is quiet for the first time since about 10:30pm. He has finally settled after another episode of bad dreams. Tonight, or this morning depending on your point of view, Tam pleaded to get out of bed so I tried to settle him on the sofa beside me but he just cried. All he kept saying is \u0026ldquo;daddy please\u0026rdquo;, asking to stay up and not to be put in bed. I even tried lying in bed with him but he just cannot settle.\nWednesday I slept from 10-1pm and Tam slept from 10-2pm but it screws the day up badly. We got busy and I pushed on to get him tired but it has not worked. So right now the clock is ticking and as soon as Starbucks is open we are on our way out, a cuppa and cake for dad and Tam will have a cup of ice, bacon sandwich and cinnamon role. From there we will work out the day and see if I can keep him busy until at least 7pm and then we will sleep. Well that\u0026rsquo;s plan A.\nWish us luck\nAlan \u0026amp; Tam\n",

    "body": "One of the things I was told early on in this journey was to \u0026ldquo;be good to yourself\u0026rdquo;. I was told this by medical professional, social services, friends, Tams teachers. At the time I could not see how to do this and also what difference it would make. I really could not see how to be good to myself. I had no idea.\n2 years later and I am trying to find a way to be \u0026ldquo;good to myself\u0026rdquo;. Right now I am working out what to do at the weekend coming. What should I do for myself? Why this weekend? Well, Tam is in respite from Friday afternoon til Monday morning. I need to make the best of this time. I need to recharge my batteries. It has been a very tough few years and an especially rough couple of months. The past few weeks I have really felt defeated.\nSo back to the question of what should I do with my weekend?\nWell, lets look at what I miss, other than Bev, and my Mam and Dad. Firstly, I am writing this at 3:15am and Tam is only just calming down after some really bad dreams. He was in bed and asleep at 9:15pm and was screaming and sobbing an hour later. He came rushing to find Mammy. Asking me to find Mammy. Now he won\u0026rsquo;t go back to sleep but at least he is calm again. 3:15am, I want to be asleep at 3:15am all weekend. I want to sleep normally all weekend. Go to bed, fall asleep, wake up and get on with the day.\nWhat else do I miss? Every time I ask myself that question I go blank.\nStretching my brain, I need to stretch my brain. I need to learn something new. I am going to sit down in front of the computer and I am going to learn something new. Spend a couple of hours seeing if my brain is capable of learning something still. I am also going to work on a friends website. That\u0026rsquo;s one thing that will feed my self worth.\nI am going to go for a run. Yes, I run. A while after Bev died I found myself running. I don\u0026rsquo;t think I have actively ran since school and at school I hated it. Since then I have discovered I can run 10 miles and be ok. I used to ask people what people who ran what they were running from. Now I know, I run from the feelings I have cascading around me. I run so that my physical tiredness matches my emotional tiredness.\nWatch the TV and have the lights on. Two things that are very difficult to do, Tam will scream at the TV if something comes on he does not like, so it\u0026rsquo;s easier not to try. I get my news on the phone with a cup of coffee. Having the lights on is something else. He has a routine where he will all of a sudden just switch the lights off and pull up the blinds as if it\u0026rsquo;s morning. I am working with him to stop this, but for now it\u0026rsquo;s a task. So having the lights on at night, the blinds down and watch shit on the TV with a takeaway. That\u0026rsquo;s one of the nights sorted.\nSo \u0026ldquo;being good to myself\u0026rdquo; has some form and function wrapped up. All I need to do is get there and make it happen. I never realised that being good to myself was so much hard work.\nHave a great weekend and try and be good to yourself.\nAlan\n",

    "body": "I don\u0026rsquo;t know if this is a thing, but whenever I have got myself to a break of more than a few days I always end up sick for the first few days. The last few days at work have been so hectic and then time off and illness. Always seemed to happen, the same thing used to happen to Bev. Not sure other people have the same thing. One thing I do know is Tam has the same reaction.\nAfter a lovely active day on Saturday Tam has succumb to the \u0026ldquo;cannot be bothered\u0026rdquo; syndrome. Today he has just wanted to lie in his nest on the sofa. He has eaten but not held it down. He asks for tickles and loves but a few seconds is all he wants. Calpol, milk and quiet is the order of the day. Some visits to the toilet to be sick and some sleep will be the pattern. I often wonder is it a bug, but the pattern is there and we deal with it according to the playbook. Quiet day.\nDuring this time there is no hand flapping or humming, no bouncing around, its just quiet stillness.

Always looking for what he would say or do.\nTam\u0026rsquo;s week has been focussed on not going to school again.\nSunday - Bad meltdown. Pleaded not to go to school. He hid under the bed. It was a struggle to get him out. A decent nights sleep.\nMonday - Up and a little meltdown. Mostly crying, not much hitting and off to school. Came back tired, wanted loads of reassurance and did not mention school once. Slept well.\nTuesday - Up late, pleaded not to go to school, spent time explaining to him why he had to go to school. I had a meeting at school which went well. I have to look at things and help Tam with his separation anxiety. He came back in one hell of a mood and before we got home he was scratching, kicking and biting. He did not calm until about 9pm when I managed to get him to eat and drink. Then it started again. Eventually he ran out of energy and slept from 4am til 8am. Off to school without much fight. Both of us very tired.\nWednesday - Better night, Tam needing lots of reassurance. He cried a lot but very little biting and scratching. He ate well which is good.\nThursday - Still carrying Tam outside, he got ready easy enough but hid when I told him it was time to go. He got home with a hat. He will not wear hats but he has pinched one from school. Got some great photos of him with a massive snake. So we went on line and learned some different types of snakes. I did not know there was so many. 5pm and Tam took himself to bed. 5:30pm and he is asleep. Oh Hell, he will wake up at midnight and be up all night. So I slept. I woke at midnight, Tam woke a couple of hours later. A little bit of upset and a talk about Mammy again. He is having lots of nightmares at the moment. Tam back to sleep by 4am. I have been getting a head start on the day. Amazing what you can get done is the quiet of the night.\nFriday - Its only 7am and Tam is still asleep. Will wake him in an hour and update this later.\nUpdate: So a good day at school on Friday. Came back tired and a little wired but no upset or meltdown. I told Tam that he has no school for a week and we went through his visual diary. Happy little lad for the rest of the night.\nSaturday he had a good lie in and pretty much refused all efforts to get him out. All he wanted was tickles, love and food. Lots of food. A proper chilled out boy. We did some reading and writing and made a camp behind the sofa. A lovely day with a lad that knows how to chill out.\nLater in the day we had a talk through about the photos on the memory wall and had a bit of a cry when Tam said \u0026ldquo;miss mammy\u0026rdquo;.\nHave a great day\nAlan \u0026amp; Tam\n",

    "body": "Something that has been really useful lately is our little mantras. I use one to get Tam\u0026rsquo;s attention if he is getting a bit disregulated. It goes like this:\n**Me : What is your name? Tam : Tam Sam Greenwell Me : What's your favourite colour? Tam : Blue Me : What's your favourite food? Tam : Apples Me : What's your favourite thing? Tam : Cuddles** and so it goes on........... It started with a couple of questions and how now expanded to about 25 questions and answers. Now it useful in many ways. The most important of these ways is to get Tam to focus on the questions and answers. I put them out of order and pluck from the questions in a random fashion. However, if Tam is in a bad place I revert back to the order we have built the questions, that seems to work better in those situations.\nA secondary part is that if for any reason he is away from me he has learnt to answer some pretty important questions like, name, age, where he lives etc. So life skills and a method to help him calm and focus on communicating rather than just melting down.\nAnother sort of mantra that we use is a visual diary. Now until recently it was just to cover the now and next\u0026rsquo;s of each day. We have extended this to show the next few weeks. Again a couple of reasons for this. Firstly, Tam and his pleading and tantrums related to school. The diary starting this week shows 5 days of school out of 15 days. Secondly the repetition of going through the week enforces the countdown to less days at school to go. It is having a small effect on Tam as I still try to use it while he is having a meltdown or in crises.\nSo the focus at the moment is repetition of our mantras. It does help and I am sure we will add more as we go along.\nSleep well\nAlan \u0026amp; Tam\n",

    "body": "Wednesday morning and Tam was on the road to getting off to school and he started to vomit. My mind was whiring. Was he really this anxious. In the months after Bevs death I was having panic attacks where I vomitted, was Tam at the horrible point?\nAfter an hour or so it became more probable that he had a stomach bug. Its Thursday night and I am still of the thought that Tam has had a stomach bug. Why am I faltering on this simple judgement, well its because I am still over focussed on the school problem. I do think it has been a stomach bug as he was sick a few times and spent most of the day laying on the sofa. Today he was lazy and could not be bothered for the first half of the day, but he has perked up at lunch time.\nNow I feel that there has been one very telling thing. Since yesterday Tam has not asked once about going to school. Not once have I heard or been asked \u0026ldquo;going to school tomorrow?\u0026rdquo;. Now to put that into perspective that question has been asked every evening for the last 3 or 4 years. Maybe 10-20 times a day, everyday (almost). As an example the 6 weeks of summer holiday will have Tam asking the question \u0026ldquo;going school tomorrow?\u0026rdquo; every day of the holiday. No matter what we were doing or where we were he would ask that question, over and over again. When the answer was \u0026ldquo;yes, school tomorrow\u0026rdquo; he would ask for a kiss and bounce.\nNot now. No question yesterday, no question today. None.\nI think that is very telling. It has placed the situation very firmally in my mind and I am spending this time trying to come up with a way forward. Couple more days of Tam at home. Back at school on Monday.\n",

    "body": "Tonight my boy is hurting. He has spent most of the night crying.\nWe tried something else tonight, straight from school we went to the cinema. They had a short on that only lasted an hour and it was a way of thanking him for day 2 at school. All was good, good communication with the school, all things worked today. So off we toddled down to the cinema.\nCustomary cake, bacon sandwich and a cuppa for Dad. No problems we had time. Things are good. Then it all started to change, Tam started asking \u0026ldquo;going to school tomorrow\u0026rdquo; and I kinda fobbed him off with \u0026ldquo;sshhhh watch the film\u0026rdquo;. He would not though. He must have switched between \u0026ldquo;going to school tomorrow\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;no school please\u0026rdquo; and after about 40 minutes he exploded. Biting scratching and screaming \u0026ldquo;no school\u0026rdquo;. I carried him out of the cinema over my shoulder being punched and bitten. We got outside as quickly as I could carry him with everyone turning and watching.\nOutside I broke down and said \u0026ldquo;no school\u0026rdquo;, yet again he cried in relief and hugged me. I wish I understood what he is scared of in relation to school.\nAfter a tearful walk home and some quiet time he attacked again. This time it only lasted a few second as he stopped and started crying and said \u0026ldquo;no school?\u0026rdquo;. I just hugged him and did not answer. Since then he has been calm. I really with I understood this fear of school.\nSo its just after midnight on Wednesday and I have myself another position I have to work out. Do I put Tam through the stress of sending him to school tomorrow and do the \u0026ldquo;please do this for daddy\u0026rdquo; or wait until I have talked to the Doctor again?

    "body": "As parents life is full of worry. It does not matter what kind of child you have its full of worry. The only thing different in being a parent of an autistic child is that you have to decipher each situation. The obvious answer is not always the answer.\nThis morning after a tough night with Tam, I spent some time explaining to him that I needed him to go to school. I did that parent thing and asked Tam to go to school for Daddy. All the time I could feel his heartbeat thumping away far to fast and his anxiety on his face. He wet himself. No fuss lets get you sorted and get ready son. So a quick shower and fresh set of clothes and off to school. My heart going fast and his. I am doing the right thing?\nNow just to be clear if Tam is unwell, with like a bad cold, I will make him a nest and let him have his iPad and keep an eye on him. But like last week while he was off school he is \u0026ldquo;physically ok\u0026rdquo; he does not get an easy day. We do \u0026ldquo;school work\u0026rdquo;, I get him to help tidying up, we do household chores together, we go for a walk and do writing or some form of learning. No iPad no easy day. Well he might get his iPad at 4:00pm but only if he has helped and actively taken part in learning.\nI just feel its important to not let Tam be lazy and also to make sure that he realises that whatever is wrong at school he still needs to learn. Missing school is something me and Bev tried to guard against. However, feeling Tams chest and seeing the tension in him tells me this is not him trying to swing the lead. He has a problem and it is my job to work this out with him.\nParenting ain\u0026rsquo;t easy, single parenting is not easy and single parenting of an autistic child in not easy. We will work this out.\nAlan \u0026amp; Tam\n Without you\nI know that I must change\nWithout you\nI\u0026rsquo;ll never be the same\nAlterbridge - Godspeed\n",

    "body": "Its 5pm on Monday Tams first day back at school since the middle of last week.\nTam is everything to me. I look at him and see the bits of Bev he has, I see the parts of me in him but in the end I see my beautiful boy. He has been handed a really bad hand in life losing his Mammy and seeing his Mammy die. I do my best to protect him and I also try to help him deal with the pain of so many things in life. I often thank my Mam and Dad for the times they let me fall, they are the times we learn. I try to let Tam have those moments, those are the difficult moments.\nNow I have been dealing with one such area for a while and that is school. Since October/November Tam has been having some issues at school or going to school. This has manifested in an angry response from him that can last from half an hour to many hours. Tam pulls his hair, throws himself around and attacks me. He is strong enough to dislocate my fingers if I am not fast enough. So last week after it getting too much for either of us and me worried about Tam hurting himself I called for help. I received the help from most corners very quickly but communication from school was still lacking. All I got was a \u0026ldquo;good morning\u0026rdquo; when Tam returned one day without his normal polo top on because he had ripped 2 polo shirts. The state of the shirts did not say accident it said anger.\nSo back to school he went to day with a few changes, slightly later start, no uniform, better communications and slightly earlier finish. Later start seemed to work, no uniform - he did not rip his clothes, better communication - no communication other than me phoning to see if he was alright, slightly earlier finish - no, he had been out on a trip. So a 50% success rate day one. When I sat my school exams that would have been an E-.\nNow just after 3:30pm Tam got home. He had cried for the last 30 seconds of the trip home. He was a bit off with me,but when we got home he was OK, wanted cuddles and tickles. Then he asked about \u0026ldquo;going to school tomorrow\u0026rdquo; and when I said yes he visibily changed. He started shaking and his face looked like thunder, he grabbed my hand asked again and in a flash, 2 dislocated fingers. Now I accept that my finger might dislocate a little easier than the norm but it is still painful. So putting them back (my mam showed me after a badminton game and a clash of raquets) and fighting Tam off as he tried to kick, scratch and bite me was par fot the course recently. In the end, after about 30 minutes, I gave in. I know by saying no school tomorrow he will calm down.\nAnd that is exactly what he did. The attack stopped, he continued to shake, and pleaded \u0026ldquo;no school tomorrow please\u0026rdquo;. He sobbed his eyes out. That stopped about when I started writing this. He is currently sitting next to me tight as can be. A bit anxious and asking about school sporadicly. What am I meant to do? Any ideas? Please let me know.\nSo school has not kept its part of the process up. I have done my best and I am sitting here wondering what I have to do to get my son back to loving school and not feeling like I am sending to a place he hates. Since Tam started at this school he has loved it. That something like 6 or 7 years he has liked it. He would ask every night \u0026ldquo;going to school tomorrow\u0026rdquo; and bounce when me or Bev said yes. If we said no (because it was the weekend) he would go back and forwards between us asking over and over again. Now he seems to hate school. He seems fearful and I keep telling him he is going or I send him without telling him.\nNow that last part is important as if Tam does not want to do something I can generally get around it by saying \u0026ldquo;daddy needs you to \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;.\u0026rdquo; whatever and he will grudgingly do it. I think he is doing the same going to school like this morning, but he is telling me he does not like it. That\u0026rsquo;s why the anger.\nSo what the hell do I do? I need him to go to school. I need him to like school. I need the rest when he goes to school. So what the hell do I do? All I want is a happy boy.\nAlan \u0026amp; Tam\n All of these lessons I\u0026rsquo;ve learned for myself\nThere is no gain worth the commerce of self\nAlterbridge - wouldnt you rather\n",

    "body": "Tam like any child with autism that is non verbal (or minimally verbal) is difficult to read. I often describe as \u0026ldquo;an enigma wrapped in a mystery stuffed in an envelope and packed into a crate\u0026rdquo;. No matter how I can read some of Tams behaviours and find ways to comfort him there is always a time when every thing I think and every action I take does not work and misses the mark that Tam needs me to find. This is frustrating for both of us.\nI spend 3 times the energy trying to understand what is going on with Tam and his reactions to things as I used to when Bev was here. I have a lot more to take into account as well. Before Bev died Tam had both of us to see things from different perspectives and he always had one of us rested and calm. Now all of his focus is on me and all of my focus is on him. There are things that only Bev or a mother could do that I cannot. This makes life harder.\nI try to remind myself that time will help and that currently all things are still new and raw. He is dealing with so much still and so am I. On good days we pull each other up and have a good day and we build memories. On a bad day we at best we struggle around each other and on a really bad day we wind each other up to a breaking point and then both cry. Those bad days normally lead to good days. Kind of the cork in the bottle popping.\nGrief, PTSD, autism, non verbal is a bad mix. It creates walls and barriers to understanding. It puts a barrier up to being able to comfort Tam. So, all I can do is show Tam all the love I have and try to make sure he understands that Daddy will help all he can.\nMaybe in the next few years I will read this blog and wonder how we made it. Maybe Tam will read it out to me and understand how hard a time we had. Maybe we will read it together and we will realise that Mammy would be proud of us. I certainly hope so.\nFor now its Sunday afternoon and I have spent days preparing to get Tam back to school. We have had moaning, crying and a few angry breakdowns. I have tried to administer a new drug to help Tam to calm but I have been a bit of fool thinking that I could get Tam to take a tablet when he is in an angry breakdown. The problem is that there is too short a warning period for his angry breakdowns. Asking him to take a tablet only ended up with accelerating the breakdown.\nAs Bev would say \u0026ldquo;its time for a rethink and a fresh start\u0026rdquo;. Make a few phone calls tomorrow and see if there is a liquid form of the drug, even though that might be just as hard to give Tam.\nRest of the day priorities, maintain the calm we have while we can, bath for Tam, bed, sleep, breakfast, dressed and school. Wish me luck.\nAlan \u0026amp; Tam\n And the tears roll down my swollen cheek, think I\u0026rsquo;m losing it, getting weaker, I hold the line\nPeter Gabriel, San Jancinto\n",

    "body": "If anyone dares to tell me that Tams current anxiety and stress is not related to school I think I will end up in the mental hospital. What I am writing took place on Friday afternoon or Saturday. It\u0026rsquo;s currently 4:11am on Sunday morning and for once we are all calm and quiet.\nThe plan that is place included me lying to Tam and getting him ready in his normal clothes (not uniform) and \u0026ldquo;taking him out\u0026rdquo; and then putting him in the taxi. Yes, this was my idea! Well I cannot live with that so for the past 2 days I have been prepping Tam for school. It has not gone well.\nFirstly Tam immediately wanted to replace school with \u0026ldquo;2 sleeps Bedeburn (respite)\u0026rdquo;. It was even said in an excited way. It was lovely to hear but I knew it was diversion from school. After lots of talking about school and setting Tams expectation of going to respite to the correct time we have come down to some behaviours that are very telling. Secondly Tam has reverted to his behaviour earlier in the week. Angry aggressive attacks,refusing food and drink and being dis-regulated.\nSo 2 days of dis-regulated, angry and aggressive Tam after getting him to a place of calm and quiet. School is important and I have to move forward and at the moment that means bringing Tam along kicking and screaming.\nWe have been using a week calendar that I have printed out and I have marked out when Tam is at school. We have 2 weeks printed out so he can see what I need him to do. I was working on the principle of if you take a 24 hour day and mark out the time out school it does not look like much, plus it shows weekends. He has 2 weeks of school and then half term and then 3 sleeps at respite and back to school. I have been basing my talks with Tam around the separation anxiety I know he has and staying away from trying to understand the \u0026ldquo;fear and anxiety\u0026rdquo; he seems to show. For now I am going to concentrate on the separation anxiety and hope that the \u0026ldquo;anxiety\u0026rdquo; is only related to that. I don\u0026rsquo;t know exactly how the school day pans out or how he is being taught but I do think that it is having an effect on Tam.\nNow every conversation has led to Tam getting aggressive. He has stayed still and listened and asked questions, he has cried and I have cried but I have tried to give a very strong message of how important school is. That message does get through and Tam does repeat things back, but the anxiety comes through.\nI know that Tam feeds off my anxiety and I have worked very hard in keeping it in check. I have kept school conversations to a positive state and really made it a positive thing. I have used all of the times that I have been proud of Tam and what he has done at school. This part has been easy because I have always been proud of Tam and how much he has loved school. I was at one point jealous of his love of school and how it became his solid goto for him after Bev died. I was jealous that he had that.\n6am Sunday morning and after a few tears and another conversation about school and that we have one more sleep and school. We are quiet again. Music quietly playing and Tam settled. School is in about 26 hours.\nYou might be asking why we have been up all night, a good question I have been asking myself that. It all stems from a conversation that me and Tam had about 5pm yesterday. It was about school, yes. It ended in an angry blowout from Tam followed by a lot of tears when he drew blood from me. That lead to a long cuddle and me telling me it was OK. With finally Tam falling asleep sobbing. He slept from about 6 til midnight. At that point he woke up full of hugs and kisses and checked the wound I had. He has been pretty settled apart from one period of upset.\nSo a couple of hours and its off to Starbucks for breakfast. Then I think we will go to the pictures and then home. It might end up being a long and upsetting day but the plan is to try to get him asleep before 9pm and up a little earlier than normal on Monday morning.\nIt has been one hell of a week. I can only hope for a good week.\nAlan \u0026amp; Tam\n It\u0026rsquo;s ugly when I cry\nI\u0026rsquo;m crying all the time in my mind\nWhere it builds and it climbs\nBeth Hart - War on my Mind\n",

    "body": "It\u0026rsquo;s currently 2:35am and after Tam had been down for a while he woke up crying and asking about school. It has taken about an hour to calm him.\nI have explained to him that no school tomorrow but he will have to go back to school soon. I have explained that school will be a little different for a little while so he can get back to it being fun. I also explained how I want him to go to school to learn things like Daddy did. Since I stopped trying to explain he has not stopped humming and is lying awake all wrapped up on the sofa with no iPad and all of the lights off. This is a difficult time because I know Tam is thinking about things and that it could lead to a full on angry meltdown and all that that contains. For now the humming will suffice.\nYesterday morning I had a constructive and helpful conversation with school. We have a plan of action for getting back to school. I am going to do the horrible thing on the first morning and tell him he is going out with normal (non uniform) clothes and then send him off in the taxi to school. We have agreed to make the transitions as quick as possible along with a load of other things that I hope will help. Plan C,D \u0026amp; E are in place and we start Monday morning. Plan F-Z are in the wings (not sure what they are) awaiting activation.\nWith no family support available to help and friends willing but me more worried for their safety it is hard. I know it is. They know it is. Having Tam at home all of the time is hard. I always feel like I have to push him and get him learning. This past few days it has been learning about favourite things and choices. Also learning that you cannot always do or have your favourite things. Doing things with him is sometimes hard work. It takes persistence to get him to focus and repetition to get it to become understood, oh and clarity, and literalness. I think that is all, no 100% attention 100% of the time, that could be focus!\nSubject with Tam can be difficult. Especially when the things I need him to understand are concepts. The concept of choice and necessity is quite difficult to get across but I think we might have had some success. Part of what I explained to Tam is that his choice would be to be at home with Dad, and Daddy wants Tam to go to school and learn. I also showed him a clock and started to teach him the clock to help him understand that he is not at school for long. Decided that the 24 hour clock was easiest to understand.\nSomething that came out of this was interesting. Tam now has 2 favourite foods and he is understanding that if he behaves and does as Daddy asks he can get away with asking for ice cream, if he has been naughty or not helping then he knows asking for ice cream is not going to work and asks for his other favourite apples. A little bit of cause and effect coming into play that shows the understanding that good boy can get favourite number 1 (ice cream) and naughty boy is better off asking for favourite number 2 (apples). Proud of him as this shows that some of the things I have tried to explain to him have taken hold. Made me smile when I asked him what his favourite food was (its been apples for ages) and he grinned and said \u0026ldquo;ice cream\u0026rdquo;. I said if you help Daddy with putting groceries away then you might get your favourite food. Well he didn\u0026rsquo;t help. A little while after I had put the fridge and freezer stuff away he pulled me to the kitchen and help put the other bits away. He then giggled and asked for his favourite food, \u0026ldquo;ICE CREAM\u0026rdquo;.\nMy main point is teaching him about choice and favourites is that I need him to understand that my favourite thing is having Tam with me, but sometimes my choice is for Tam to go to school or respite. My choice might not be what I want but it is something we have to do. I am not explaining that very well but I hope you get the gist. Imagine having an autistic brain and trying to get the concepts of choice, need, want, favourite, it muddles my brain. I feel like I did a much better job explaining it to Tam than I have here.\nOh, the humming from Tam has just stopped (2:56am). He might have fallen asleep. Score for today is sore ribs from a shoulder charge when he woke earlier but no cuts, or bruises. A good day.\nSo far this week in summary : counselling is on hold/temporary discharge (3 cancelled sessions), anti-depressants I have abandoned the idea of trying to come off, other drugs to continue in parallel, bites, scratches, bruises, Tams food intake has returned to normal, constipation (Tam) gone, sleep deprived (me), knackered (both of us), fighting a cold (not coronavirus), and finally some light at the end of the tunnel in getting Tam back to school.\nTomorrow is art day, going to do some painting and gluing. I have ripped up some old clothes and got a bit of thick cardboard for us to glue bits onto. The painting will be around things we have done the past few days. If all goes well then we will go out for another of Tams favourites which is a cuppa and cake at Starbucks.\n3:20am and I have carried my 50kilo boy into bed and he has not even stirred, doing this always makes me think of my mam and dad and how many times they must have done that with me as a kid. I miss them so much.\nNow its my turn for sleep. Hope Tam sleeps well.\nSleep well\nAlan \u0026amp; Tam\nPS I hope Bev\u0026rsquo;s OK with the plan for getting back to school.

    "body": "I have a load of posts that I have been working on that just need a bit more work. The problem is that Tam is creating a lot of work and worry at the moments. It\u0026rsquo;s only Tuesday night and this is what we have had so far.\nSunday was OK until the mention of school occurred. Then all hell broke loose. After wrapping Tam in a quilt and calming him down I explained why he had to go to school and that daddy needed to make him happy to go. I spent hours on this. I got him into an OK state but he was still obviously anxious and cried quite a few times.\nMonday morning was not easy but I kept a smile on my face and told Tam everything was OK and that I loved him. I explained again why he had to go to school. After a bit of school uniform on, school uniform off we made a rapid exit from the flat with him over my shoulder. He got into the taxi and off to school.\nMonday night, a very upset boy. Attack mode within 30 minutes of getting home. Refused to eat or drink and then while crying asking about \u0026ldquo;going to school tomorrow?\u0026rdquo;. More attacks and a lot of him pulling his hair. Eventually we got settled and I got him to sleep.\nTuesday morning, more of the same. Uniform on and off, and then a quick over the shoulder and out the door. Off to school he went. Later in the morning I had a conversation with the Children\u0026rsquo;s Phycological services and they explained that Tam is doing OK at school and he is better than he was at the old school site. I explained that I did not feel that way. A meeting was organised for February 11th. A bit far away but at least it was organised.\nTuesday afternoon and Tam comes home. Not in the blue polo shirt but in a sweatshirt. When I looked at his school diary it said \u0026ldquo;He had a nice day but ripped 2 polo shirts, no reason for him doing it\u0026rdquo;. At this point I saw red. How the hell could there be no reason for ripping 2 shirts. For gods sake, there is must be a reason for him ripping 2 shirts to pieces. What the hell is going on.\nAfter Tam had been home for about an hour (of which the hour was peaceful with the same situation of not wanting food or drink) he came across and asked me \u0026ldquo;going to school tomorrow?\u0026rdquo; and I said \u0026ldquo;yes you are going to school tomorrow\u0026rdquo;. He sat back down and then after a few seconds went into attack mode. A few scratches and bites later I said in frustration \u0026ldquo;OK you are not going to school tomorrow\u0026rdquo;. He stopped dead in his tracks and started to cry. The crying was relief, unmistakable relief. I was shocked at the change and with very little trepidation hugged him tight. Now previously I have hugged him after he has been angry and been bitten. This time was different, the tears were tears of relief.\nSince that happened Tam has asked several times \u0026ldquo;going to school tomorrow?\u0026rdquo; and I have stuck to no. He has eaten and drank. He is relaxed.\nI have minor scratches and bruises. Still plastered over but minor compared to other nights. Minor compared to last Friday morning. How the hell can I send him to school when I can see the daily upset and stress this is causing him. Tomorrow will be a day of phone calls.\nTam is very obviously stressed by school. T-shirt ripping at school is not something he has done before this academic year. Fighting the night before going to school and then in the morning have not been a part of Tam. I need to know what is going on and it needs fixing. I feel made that communication has been so difficult and that this kind of behaviour is seen as normal.\nI know being frightened to tell my boy he is going to school is not normal. I am covered is scratches, bites and bruises, that is not normal. It is time for action to get my son happy to go to school again. He used to love it before this year.\nUpdate @ 2:06am After a lot more upset and Tam pleading \u0026ldquo;No school please\u0026rdquo; with bucket loads of tears I have managed to get him to relax and sleep. Don\u0026rsquo;t know what the morning will bring. I don\u0026rsquo;t feel like I can send him. Tonight I have managed to save us from clashing heads like last Thursday night but it all makes me feel uneasy.\nUpdate @ 7:27am Tam had about 30 minutes sleep. Very restless. Still periods of crying and anger. Managed to get him mostly settled. Hopefully he will sleep now. Got to start making phone calls, and work out the next steps. Heartbreaking night and not expecting a much better day.\n",

    "body": "Tam has come home from school. He looks tired and loaded with cold. He could not be bothered with going out to the shops or for something to eat and cried when I asked him. So pyjama night it is. Wednesday nights are always Starbucks nights, a carry over from when Bev would take him out to meet a friend in town.\nTonight has turned into another thing that Bev used to try with Tam and she even went on a training course about it. Therapressure. It\u0026rsquo;s the process of brushing parts of arm, legs etc with a plastic brush. Now I cannot remember exactly how she did it but more on that soon.\nSo how did this come about. Mainly because Tams hair is getting longer. Last time it was cut I did it. I was desperate and I found him in a lovely mood just before giftmas and I sat and trimmed it in a fashion I had watched professionals do. It took a long while but it ended up alright. Well alright until he got his hair cut properly.\nHair cut properly, when is that going to happen I ask myself. We have tried a few times to do that exact thing the past couple of weeks and the barbers has either been packed or Tam has fought too hard or melted down as soon as it was mentioned. So what else could I do?\nI bought a tangle teaser brush. If his hair is going to get a bit longer then I need to keep it tidy at least and I have been failing at that recently. Well that tangle teaser brush has ended up being a therapressure brush. A massage brush if you like. I showed Tam the brush and brushed his hair and in his tired and poorly (laying that on thick on his behalf) state he could not stop himself from giggling. Next he was pushing my hand (and brush) to brush his legs and arms. Then he sat on the floor in front of me so that he could have his shoulders and back brushed. When I stopped he grabbed my hand and started me off again, brushing him. All the time he is giggling.\nIt has been a beautiful 30 minutes of Tam and me being content and happy. Those moments do exist. And yes sweetheart I am still thinking about you.\nBe good\nAlan and Tam\n",

    "body": "I look back at the past few years and try to understand everything that I have lost. I have lost my Dad, my Mam to dementia and then to death, and my love and sole mate Bev so very suddenly. Taken too soon. I try to take in all of that loss and work out how to become less fragile and how to nurse my tiny little soul back to some form of semblance of order again.\nTwo years after losing Bev I am still so very fragile, so scared of the world. I get mad with myself when I start to get anxious when I check the mail. How is that my fragile little soul is so nervous about the world? I think the only thing in my life that does not give me anxiety is feeding (as me and Tam call them) Mammies Crows. They make no judgement, they appreciate pizza, bread, pepperoni and waffles with equal gusto. Within seconds of me opening the window to put something out for them they have formed an orderly queue on the fire escape and patiently caw at me and each other. Then as soon as the first crumb hits the roof they are peeling off and grabbing their treats. One of the crows who has a couple of white feathers on the inside of his wing always waits and is last to feed. I feel like he is the outsider of the murder. He is very patient and always gives me a look as if to say thanks.\nThe first crow to feed has a peppercorn look to their head plume. Maybe a sign of a life long lived. I often wonder what he or she has seen in their life. If only we could talk to the animals.\nBack to being fragile.\nThe past few days I have started to question my desire to come of my antidepressants. I had one panic attack that was filled with stomach cramps and racing heart. All I have done is to change my intake by 50% on alternate days. 30mg one day and 20mg the next day. Not sure its working, and not sure it is the right thing to do any more.\nI am going for a walk as my anxiety of thinking about this.\nBack from my walk and all I bought was coffee, forgot to get some bread. Oh well.\nToday\u0026rsquo;s breakfast for the crows was mini pepperoni left from Tams pizza. For some reason he loves normal size pepperoni but not the stuff that is about 12mm across. Go figure. At least he has stopped asking me to remove them. I hate oily fingers.\nTime now to get a few bits of house work done and check the net for any work I can fit in before Tam gets home. I have given him the option of going to Pizza Hut for tea as he was so good at respite over the weekend and was so very very cuddly last night. I wonder if he will go for it or settle for pyjama night again.\nBe well\nAlan \u0026amp; Tam\n",

    "body": "2 Years have passed and you are missed more every day my love. Its 2 years since we touched and talked and those 2 years have been the hardest of our lives.\nTam is growing so fast, I think he would be taller than you now. Right now his hair is not as short as it has been but I have to fix that soon. He won\u0026rsquo;t let me brush his hair the way he used to with you. He has your wilful way, he is determined and won\u0026rsquo;t take no for an answer. Just like you.\nHe also has your walk, he drifts along, barely making a sound with his hair blowing in the breeze. I love to fall behind him and watch him when he is happy. It makes me smile that he has your walk.\nOh, one thing you are missing is puberty. I cannot really remember going through it but Tam is having some issues and everything is funny. Not so much for me but he is in the world of discovery. Anything more is best left unsaid. I just thought you should know.\nEvery time I look at Tam I see you in his eyes. His eyes change so much in different lights but when he comes up close to ask me something and his nose is almost touching mine its your eyes that he looks through. The moments it is so obvious is when he is asking about going to the pictures. He has to go through the \u0026ldquo;going to the pictures tomorrow\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;going to Cineworld\u0026rdquo;, and finally \u0026ldquo;going to see\u0026hellip;.\u0026rdquo; all with his nose almost touching mine and his eyes all bright and sparkling. You would love it, I do.\nSchool has been a bit of a challenge for Tam the last month. As it was last year, but we will see if that calms down next term. His speaking is coming on thought. He asks for all kinds of things, but the funniest is when the sink is full of dishes. The way he says \u0026ldquo;Oh Daddy\u0026rdquo; is so funny I can hear you prompting him. He gets me to change the water and then he gets to washing up. He is so good at it. The dishes are all stacked beautifully and immaculately clean.\nI have been so proud of Tam moving to the big school. New site, different layout. He has taken to it really well. You would like Tams taxi driver Graeme and Claire his new escort. They are both really good.\nOne of Tams newest things is that when he comes in from school he sees what has been moved and checks for presents. I use your handbags to leave him little things. During this time he puts dishes in the sink, his uniform comes off and goes in the washing machine and everything is put in its place. Sometimes I leave things lying around for him to sort out. Then once he has done that he drags me to my seat and gets his iPad and chills next to me. He is a man of great habits.\nOne of the hardest things I have done is organise for Tam to have visits to a respite place. You heard about it plenty and you would love the place and staff. Ian his main carer is brilliant with Tam and has taken a lot of time to make sure that Tam has settled there. The staff have been brilliant with Tam. It has been a tough road but Tam is getting to the point of enjoying it. It gives him a rest from me. I often feel sad about sending him to Bedeburn, and wonder what you would say about it all. But I look at it from the point of view of Tams needs and I make it as positive as I can for him. He asks about going to Bedeburn and now we have got to the point of its an adventure and no tears.\nDarling, we both miss you so much, you have left a hole in our lives that is so big it has been difficult at times for both of us to keep going. We feed off each other and we push each other onwards. Everything we do we take you with us and you are in our thoughts. We take you along with us in our heads and hearts and I feel your presence in our boy everyday.\nTam still likes to have Channel 5 on the TV. All of the \u0026ldquo;Housewives of\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; plays on in the background for comfort. Neither of us watch them, they just play in the background. It only meant something to watch them with you.\nHealth wise we are doing better. I have Tam physically fitter than he has been over the past 2 years and I am trying to look after myself better. It is Tams mental health that worries me the most but we are getting help on that. Doc Davies keeps us both right.\nWe miss you every waking moment, we miss you voice and your smile. We miss your loving touch. We miss your laugh. We miss your teacher voice when we mess on too much and the tickles become too much. I miss watching you and Tam snuggling on the sofa with him refusing to move unless you move first. I miss the brightness, love and joy you brought into our lives.\nI would give anything for our boy to spend more time with you. Just to see the two of you again with the love and warmth that you both shared. It breaks my heart that I will never see that again. I remind Tam everyday how much you loved him. I show him the photos on the memory wall we have and we talk about each picture. I watch him and see him mouthing the words I say. The last time he asked to get the stories of the pictures he sat next to me and I could smell your perfume. He had been in his memory box and sprayed himself with Clinique Happy and Burberry London. I cried with him.\nSleep well and fly free my love.\nAll of our love\nAlan \u0026amp; Tam\n",

    "body": "Box Day\nA totally meaningless day on the calendar now, and an attempt at a quite day that did not work. Tam was not in a great mood and everything has wound him up. I am tired and he is feeding off that.\n27th\nTam had the afternoon out today. Ian and Percy took Tam out for a run around. I stayed at home to get tidied up. Managed to make time for a bit of kip.\nHe came back smelling of fresh air. He was fine when he got home and was full of cuddles. That changed later in the evening. Things started to wind Tam up. Little things caused meltdown and screaming fits. He spiralled out of control no matter what I did. Not much rest for either of us.\n28th\nWe managed to get out today. With the help of a careful countdown and a very specific shop we got out for an hour.\nTam has spent a lot of time looking at the memory wall and putting Mammy\u0026rsquo;s perfume on from his memory box. The flat smells so strongly of Clinique Happy for Women. It\u0026rsquo;s mixed with some Burberry London which he does not use as much.\nHe is chilled and I have protected him from as much as I can of what happen 2 years ago today. All day my heart has been thumping away. Missing beats, speeding up slowing down. Its been all over the place. I can hardly bring myself to eat but I have forced myself to sit with Tam and eat with him.\nAll of my energy today is to hid how I am feeling from Tam. He has his own feeling and thoughts and I don\u0026rsquo;t want to add my memories or intense sadness to it. Bev has left such a massive hole in our lives, I am trying my best to wrap that hole with good memories for both Tam and me, but that hole she filled so beautifully is so bloody big.\nAt the time I am writing this I can remember what we were doing 2 years ago. Its been like this all day. Each hour that passes and I pull up the picture in my head as to what happened 2 years ago.\nAfter a bit of a trip Tam has been chilled and happy to sit with me for the last few hours. I hope it stays like that. I am not going to try to get him to bed at any specific time. I am going to let him call the shots. You might think that is bad parenting and you might be right but my boy being chilled and happy doing what he is doing is far more important to me than causing a ruckus with him. We don\u0026rsquo;t need to be up for anything special so if he decides to sleep at 3am and is chilled until then so be it.\nI hope you all had a good giftmas (sorry cannot say the other word) and you spent it with someone important and that you made them feel important.\nAlan \u0026amp; Tam\n",

    "body": "Its giftmas day. No decorations no wishing a happy giftmas.\nTam slept pretty bad last night, lots of waking and crying. A couple of minor fights, a few scratches but I did get him back to sleep each time. I managed to have a couple of hours but I spent most of the time watching over Tam. My sleep was interrupted with flash backs and I was finding it hard to settle so I got comfortable in a chair outside Tams bedroom and watched him sleep while trying to read a book.\nWhat we do have right now is a quiet house, fed and watered for now and we are cuddled up watching Spiderman. We are not watching the Marvel Universe ones, we are watching all of the old ones. Its a gift I hid for Tam to find this morning. All of the gifts I hid for him were found in the first 90 seconds. No wrapping paper, no fuss about gifts. With no fuss comes no meltdown. The DVDs were checked out, given to me to digitise and then put away.\nI do feel really guilty about the way we have Giftmas. I feel like my beautiful boy is missing out. I feel that Bev would be really disappointed in how we are today. I feel like she is screaming at us right now. No Giftmas dinner, Tam has already asked for pizza.Last night was a bit of a trial, Tam woke up lots crying. Thankfully there was no violent outbursts. All he wanted was cuddles and milk. The pain I feel when I hear him crying for mammy.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know how many Giftmases will be like this. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if we will ever have another normal Giftmas. Right now I don\u0026rsquo;t really care, we miss Mammy and all is quiet.\n",

    "body": "Today should have been Tams last day at school before the christmas break. It ended up not being that way.This morning he was spun up and running on empty after not getting much sleep. The time came to get ready and all hell broke loose. He got really upset and screaming. Asking for tight cuddles and asking \u0026lsquo;stay with daddy\u0026rsquo;. I pushed on.\nWe had cuddles, I talked about it being his last day at school for a couple of weeks but it did not work.\nI managed to get Tam ready but when i turned my back to sort out his school bag I heard a rip. Just like the incredible hulk, Tam had ripped his school shirt right down the front. Not really unexpected since he returned from school yesterday with a ripped school shirt and was wearing a spare.After a bit of a one sided conversation we tried again. Same result. I was not fast enough to stop him.Change of tack. Jeans and t-shirt. See if we can move forward, and get him to school. No joy.\nAt this point Tam was getting more and more aggressive and more upset. He was on his knees asking \u0026lsquo;stay with daddy please\u0026rsquo; with a huge emphasis on the please.\nI did not want him to spiral out of control so I called halt. I called transport and school and explained that I was concerned that Tam was in such a state that I did not want to put myself or anyone else in danger. I had give in to Tam and was keeping him off school. I failed.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s now 11am and all is calm at home. We have rented a movie and any decisions about how these holidays go and what we do will have to wait. Right now Tam is calm. I am calm. Right now that is all that matters.\n",

    "body": "Its been a while since I have posted anything to the blog.\nThe main reason being is that things have been very difficult. Christmas is bringing a lot of reaction from Tam that is at times difficult to deal with and heartbreaking. I have had to unplug the TV aerial because the christmas adverts are sending him into a spin. He rushes to to get the remote control when he realises that the adverts are coming on and stands all wound up and flapping his hands and as soon as a christmas advert appears he changes channel. The problem arises when he does not wait long enough to get back to the program he wants to watch. Then he starts to scream and attacks me. I switch the TV off and he rushes to switch it back on and it spirals out of control. So now the aerial is unplugged.\nOver the next few weeks we have a lot going on and a lot of plans have had to be shelved. Christmas is going to be hard.\nTams outbursts at the moment are the worst. He goes into full on attack mode. He tries to scratch, bite, kick and bend fingers back. He does not do it out of malice for me, he does it because I am his constant and he wants me to fix it. The problem is that I don\u0026rsquo;t know how to fix it. I wish I had the smallest of inclining on how to fix this for him but I don\u0026rsquo;t. I would take it all from him if I could and carry the burden silently..\nOver this weekend Tam has been very cuddly and quiet for Friday and Saturday. Sunday however has been a very different day. It has been full of Tam striking out. It has been to the extent that it is 4 am and I have not slept. I had to put him in bed and shut the door and sit outside until he fell asleep. He cried for ages and I cried quietly outside his room.\nI was just about to write that he was still asleep, but he woke up and got mad because I had my jeans and sweatshirt on. It now after 5 am and he is somewhere approaching settled. I made the mistake of lying with him and out of nowhere he grabbed my hands and started bending fingers and scratching. Right now it is difficult to do the thing that is most important for Tam which is to keep him calm and get him to sleep. He has gone too many months with really poor sleep. I find it more settling to get him to sleep and quietly potter around and tidy up. Then sleep during the day.\nJust before Tam got ready to go to school he gave me a really tight hug and asked not to go to school. He cried when I told him he had to go to school. He then wet and soiled himself twice. Two uniforms in the washing machine and its only Monday. That\u0026rsquo;s the first time ever he has asked to not go to school. Now I have something else to think and worry about.\nIts now 9 am and Tam is off to school. I wish I could take the confusion and grief away from my boy.\n",

    "body": "One of the best ways for me to learn is to reflect on my actions and look for progress in as many ways as I can. This process can be a bit rough as I am no where near perfect and if the truth be known I am a pretty faulty version of what is commonly known as the human race.\nI look at people and wonder why they act in a particular way, I hate seeing people being offensive or even indifferent to other people. I also dislike people who look down on other people. We all have a place on this planet and we all have a right to be respected.\nOne life lesson I remember was my boss Phil Simmons when I was at Black \u0026amp; Decker sitting on a step at the back of the offices with one of the cleaners having a cigarette and chatting about office politics. I ended up sitting with them and learning so much about office life in those few short minutes. Phil showed me that day that everyone is important and all perspective on a subject should be listened to. I have tried to carry that fire with me ever since.\nSo in the interests of forcing myself to do this here we go.\nLooking after Tam I suppose this breaks down to a lot of levels.\nHealth. Physical and Mental Tam\u0026rsquo;s physical health is definitely connected to his sleep and then to his mental health. I have tried a whole range of techniques, drugs, methods and patience to help Tam with his sleep. At the moment it is a little better than it was a year ago, but it is still not a healthy amount of sleep. I am starting to accept that the only cure to better sleep will be time. Grief never leaves us, but what we do is wrap a new life around the hole we have inside. Tam will do that in his own good time.\nI think it is worth pointing out that I don\u0026rsquo;t kid myself in thinking that in time Tam will sleep all night for 8 hour, 7 days a week and 365 days a year. I only want him to get to a more healthy place. A unbroken night of sleep, much fewer nightmares and a better wake up.\nTaking into account that his sleep has been so poor I have worked hard to keep him healthy in every other way.\nFood The first 15 months or so after Bev died Tam would pick at his food or just plain refuse it. His variety of food he would eat was always limited but he would greed from our plates, especially Bev\u0026rsquo;s. He tried curries, Chinese, even kebab. From mammies plate he would try anything, no matter how spicy or plain. After she died, the most he would have is bacon, mushroom, noodle or chips.\nI have worked hard to expand that menu. Now he eats a good variety of cakes, doughnuts, and even some biscuits and cookies. He has added home made burgers, tons of pasta dishes and still loves his favourites. One of the best things he likes is trout. Head and tail on cooked in oven, then head, tail and bones removed. Takes 30 minutes to cook and 20 seconds to eat. Also he has recently added chicken with soy and chilli sauce. So in this I feel like he is moving forward and the method of make it look like its in short supply and its daddies meal normally generates enough interest for him to try it, if not steal it. :)\nTwo areas I am falling short. Tam prefers finger food with little or no sauce, and his use of cutlery is very limited and has to be pushed. Need to push this more.\nSafety It has taken me over a year and a half to loosen the reins on Tam. He now has an escort to take him to school. That is the way it should be.\nTam\u0026rsquo;s outbursts at the moment are based around everything christmas. He connects christmas decorations with his Mammy dying. It is impossible to keep this away from him. The commercial juggernaut is everywhere. Well everywhere apart from our home. His reaction to christmas decorations in shops mean that it is better to protect him and stay away rather than put him through it.\nTam is happy at home, he is more relaxed than anywhere else. Anywhere else apart from the Lake District that is. We need a trip to the Lakes.\nIncontinence Over the past two weeks this has become a problem again. After a period of dry beds, he is back to wetting the bed (even with a nappy on). I think in 14 days we have had one dry night. This is even with Tam not wanting to sleep and me putting him in bed after he has totally run out of energy and fallen asleep. We continue with the gentle persuasion and monotones voice. This is something that Tam cannot help and I can only guide him through the time it will take.\nSchool Tam asks every night about it being school tomorrow. He asks about going to school all the way through holidays. He thrives on the routine. The school he goes to is excellent with the best teachers and teaching assistants.\nI worry most about Tam\u0026rsquo;s outbursts. He grabs peoples glasses and throws them, if he is shocked by a noise he can grab people or pull there hair. He has broken things and hurt people. This worries me the most. Plus the last couple of weeks Tam has been more \u0026ldquo;violent\u0026rdquo; at night. It comes from frustration and grief. I am in daily contact with the school via his diary and meetings at school. I understand that this kind of behaviour is more common with autistic kids but I don\u0026rsquo;t want my son hurting people or destroying things.\nExercise We go for as many walks as we can. Tam likes to have a walk around the local park at the moment. The usual shopping trips are on hold until January. Probably the biggest exercise that Tam loves is rough and tumble and tickles. It gets us both laughing and it is great bonding time.\nPersonal Hygiene Now this is a difficult one. Tam is going through puberty. He can go in the shower or bath and scrub him with the \u0026lsquo;mint original source\u0026rsquo; shower gel and 5 minutes later he smell like a pubescent boy again.\nApart from that Tam is getting better and bathing and showering. I can leave him to get foamed up and rinse, he can dry himself pretty good. I have to wash his hair.\nOn a night when he comes home from school he strips his uniform off and puts it in the washing machine. So great progress there.\nTam can wash a bowl of plates and dishes after he has finished his tea. If there are more than a couple of plates he will ask me to fill it with water, he will put the washing up liquid in. Then he will clean everything and put it on the draining board. I get a high five and he is off playing. Makes me smile every time.\nConclusion Alan is Now writing this all down makes it read better than what it feels inside my head. This is part of my problem, I cannot see the wood for the trees. I am too close to the situation.\nOne of the things I have done since Bev died is to keep a journal. I often go back through that journal and look at how things were 3, 6 or 12 months ago. It serves as a reminder that most things are getting better. In the same way truthfully writing down what is going on is a good way to see that its not all bad.\nSo to do list is\n keep going and stop panicking be good to yourself eat regularly and healthy go for a run  Take care and keep dry\nAlan \u0026amp; Tam\n",

    "body": "This weekend has been terrible for sleep. Tam has soldiered on with about 4 hours sleep total. It\u0026rsquo;s Sunday evening and I have been trying to talk to him about sleep and it has degraded into him attacking me. I have a bit mark on my hand and a cut on my nose. Everything I have done to calm him down has failed. I have him in bed with a red led strip under the bed and he is crying and tossing around. It breaks my heart. He has school tomorrow and the lack of sleep worries me as it can affect his behaviour.\nThat is probably a picture that a lot of parents with autistic kids understand. It\u0026rsquo;s a real picture that on nights like tonight is tough to cope with. Right now I have my little lad (well little in my eyes) throwing himself around in his bedroom with me sitting in the door way trying to tell him it\u0026rsquo;s OK and he just needs to stop and relax.\nThe medication I have to help Tam sleep has stopped working. All I can do is keep at this until this phase of Tams behaviour changes.\nPart of the problem is that in Tams eyes he saw his mummy go to sleep and she has not come back. For long enough he thought we had left her in hospital until I took him back to the ward to see she was not there. I think that it\u0026rsquo;s not Tam sleeping that is the issue. I think that Tam does not want me to sleep and go away like mammy.\nI have sat with him and tried to explain, drawn cartoons, I have even tested it out. One night I made out that I had fallen asleep and Tam rushed over to me and shook me shouting \u0026lsquo;daddy daddy\u0026rsquo; and crying. It took a couple of hours for him to settle down. He did not sleep that night or leave my side. He was very anxious most of the next day. You see when Tam does sleep it is because he is absolutely shattered and physically cannot stay awake. I am always awake when he is awake and most of the time awake when he wakes up. Needless to say I will not repeat that test again.\nHe most definitely has this incorrect understanding that mammy slept and went away. I cannot get the idea of death being a very different situation to sleep into his understanding of the world.\nI feel like I am running out of ideas as far as getting Tam to sleep. It is worrying because Tams physical health suffers when he does not sleep. As does mine.\nUpdate: its just after 4am and Tam has been quiet for the last 30 minutes or so. At least he is resting now. I think sleep will come soon and once he is asleep I will sleep. Got to be up in a couple of hours.\n",

    "body": "The past week has been a tough week in comparison to the previous week.\nTam struggled to sleep and settle at night over the weekend. It was like something had switched on inside him. His behaviour was fine, he was quiet during the night, but as soon as I pushed him into going to bed or lying down he got really really upset. The tears and sobs were all real, the anxiety was visible in him. Also if I lay down on the sofa he got real upset as well. The tension in his shoulders and neck were so visible. As much as I stayed chilled and kept my tone of voice bright and cheerful he was as tense as can be. That went on from Friday night until Monday night. He went to school fine, he slept a couple of hours on Saturday and Sunday when he just ran out of energy but basically went for 20 plus hours at a time.\nOn Wednesday morning I told Tam that he was going to respite for two sleeps. His reaction was OK. This was going to be a tough time as I would not see him until Friday afternoon. 50 plus hours of not seeing him, the longest time apart since Bev died. I had to use the time wisely to recharge my batteries, do a few jobs around the house that I cannot do with Tam around and just relax.\nI am not the best person in the world for relaxing, especially when I need to. I like to be busy, so in the best tradition of not doing what I am supposed to be doing I got busy. My mind did not move from worrying about how Tam was doing and if it was not thinking about that then thinking about Bev was front and centre. Relaxing, I have forgotten how to do that. At least I slept.\nTam came home on Friday and has been really cuddly. During the night he was sick, the only way I can describe it is that he purges himself. He throws up anything he has eaten and then goes quiet for a few hours. I ended up carrying him into bed and lying beside him all night. He woke up and has been quiet and very clingy all day. He does not have a virus or bad stomach, it is just one of the processes that he goes through when he is anxious.\nProbably have a quiet day tomorrow as well.\n",

    "body": "The past week has been a good one. Starting Monday to Friday morning Tam slept exceptionally well for 3 out of the 4 nights. Down early and up early but solid uninterrupted sleep. It was absolutely brilliant. I felt rested, and he looked much more rested.\nThis was the first full week of me not being Tams escort as well. I basically have a couple of more hours to get things sorted every day. With Tam sleeping it felt like I had a lot of time to get tidied up and get some proper cleaning done. Only one of the days did I feel the need to get some sleep.\nThe only downside in the past week was that it is now not a good idea to take Tam into town. All of the christmas decorations are up in the high street and shopping centre. I took him in briefly not realising that and I could feel Tam as tense as could be. He went into HMV and came out within minutes. He was basically cowering and saying happy christmas in a sarcastic tone. I managed to get him onto the outskirts of town away from decorations before he lost it and had a meltdown. The tears really flowed. We spent half an hour sitting and cuddling with his head buried in my shoulder before I could get him walking again. He only properly calmed down after we had been home for a couple of hours. No more going into town with him until the end of January next year.\nI have no idea how long it will take before Tam can appreciate christmas again.\nSo in all a good week. For the first time I have felt like we have progressed to a truly better place, still with a huge hole in our lives, but a better place.\nNote : I intentionally spell christmas with a small c to place the importance of the day where it belongs.\n",

Right now he is sitting quiet with his iPad paused watching Wildlife SOS. All is quiet, nice and quiet.\nWhat has the last 9 days been like. Well it started off badly with Tam being ill. He spent the best part of 2 days being sick. He was in a bit of a state but the meds that we got helped and soon he was feeling better. It was a bit of a frantic time cleaning and tidying as we went but Tam likes to help so not so bad. More worried and anxious about what was wrong with him.\nThe rest of the time has had its good moments and its bad moments. As usual one of the hardest things to deal with has been sleep. Over 9 days I think the total amount of sleep is probably about 20-24 hours. I have to admit that I had to shut the door and lie in front of it for 20 minutes sleep to keep going.\nTams separation anxiety has not abated. It is as bad as ever. He is my constant 3D shadow.

    "body": "This is probably going to be the hardest post to write from a personal point of view.\nWhen my Dad died a realisation came about to do with my Mam\u0026rsquo;s mental state. She had dementia. She was diagnosed with a particularly horrible version called Lewy Bodies. She lived in a world that existed in her head but not in reality. She saw children in a basement we did not have. She talked about visitors that did not exist. At times she looked terrified.\nAfter she was moved into a nursing home for her own safety things got worse. I have always had a good relationship with my parents and have tried to look after them in their later years like they did for me in my early years. Putting Mam in a nursing home was not easy, but looking after her at home and Tam was becoming impossible. Things got even worse, my cuddly Mam lost weight and her condition got worse. Then she starting having moments of what appeared to be lucidity. Her face would change, she would stand taller and ask me for a cig and then once I had lit it for her she would plead with me to kill her. This happened over and over again until one night I totally broke down. I sat in the car for hours crying. Bev eventually talked me down and got me home. I had a nervous breakdown. Another followed weeks later when I had an argument with Bev about going to see Mam and ended up walking around town from 10am until 3am the following day. It ended when I could walk no more and was approached by a policeman. I got home safe and saw a doctor again. Up until this point I had been drinking heavily and hiding it from Bev. She would fall asleep watching the TV with me and I would have another bottle of wine. At least 1.5 bottles of wine a night. I was drinking to forget. I stopped the night the police took me home. I have not drank since.\nAt this point I started talking antidepressants. At first I was scared of them. Then when I got over that it made me so foggy that anything outside of the bubble I was in was not part of my world. After trying different kinds I got to a place I could operate. All of this time I did not see my Mam. That was the doctors advice as well as Bev.\nMy Mam passed and another weird breakdown. This was like mania. The drugs continued but I felt a sense of peace that my Mam was at peace. Our family started to get to normality and Bev had pieced me back together. For the first time in a few Christmas\u0026rsquo;s we headed to a holiday with some stability and normality. I was more than happy with Bev and Tam and I pushed myself to be the best I could. I made sure they both knew how much they meant to me. I tried my best to be my best.\nThen my world collapsed again. Bev died leaving me and Tam. My world collapsing had to wait. I had to be strong and concentrate on Tam. I had to organise a funeral, keep my boy safe, keep myself going, had to deal with insurance, pension, coroners, and a myriad of other people with essentially no help. Tams school provided the most help, they put things in place and accepted a lot of things about Tams behaviour. My mate Micky as usual asked no questions and was most supportive.\nI had reviews with our family doctor who was brilliant and I started again on anti-depressants. We went at a pace I could cope with and over the last year we have got to a much better place. I like the fact that our Doctor will keep me in check if I am trying to go too far or too fast.\nSo I take anti-depressants and beta blockers to keep me squared up. It has taken time to get to a good place, but I think that is part of the stages of grief, plus getting Tam to a better place. Yes, it has taken time, but I think with everything that has gone on it was stupid in hindsight to have expected quicker results. I am in a place where I feel more competent to look after myself and Tam.\nSome people see mental health as a weakness. Some people would love to mock me for taking anti-depressants. I say that taking anti-depressant is not a weakness, I think it takes strength to accept the difficulties of life and realise that you need help. I think that people who admit there need for help are some of the strongest around. The ability to look within and release that you need help is a strength not a weakness. So anyone who mocks people with mental health issues, be damn careful, you will be visited by mental health issues at some time in your life. For one thing grief visits us all.\nPS Sorry for writing 2 posts in a day. This is what happens when Tam won\u0026rsquo;t sleep. It 3:53BST and no signs of Tam sleeping.\n",

    "body": "Wednesday and Thursday this past week Tam has shown some very difficult behaviour at school.\nHe has bitten people and broken things. Now at home on Wednesday all was, I would say, OK. Thursday night was not OK. It felt that everything came to a head. Tam exploded, he had meltdowns, aggressive breakdowns, periods of humming loudly to himself and finally, the nice part, he kept coming up to me and wrapping his arms around my neck and hugging me tight and crying. He would squash his face in so tight to my shoulder protecting his eyes. He was totally unable to come down from this very highly stressed place. Sleep was impossible. In all he slept for less than an hour and I must have just closed my eyes and he was jumping on top of me with wild eyes, hands like claws and teeth. He managed to scratch and bite me. It took ages to calm him down before I could put a plaster on the bite.\nWith all of this going on, my mind was looking for what was affecting Tam. All of this together is heartbreaking. Was it an external influence that I could no see or hear, was it his grief taking over again, was it flash backs to his mummy dying. What the hell was it that was causing this behaviour. Also this was the first week that I had stopped being Tams escort to school. Each part of this taken alone was not unheard of behaviour with Tam, taken all together in the volume it was happening was a first. It was very high intensity stuff.\nMy mistake I realised was looking for one problem. Recently it has been so easy to look for one problem and lay all of Tams issues at that door. Tams meltdown could be dropped at the door of autism, sound sensitive or feeling overcrowded. Tam crying and singing to his mammies picture on her birthday was at the door of grief. Him lashing out on Thursday night might be his PTSD of seeing his mammy die. It could be his hormones as puberty seems to have taken hold. You get my point I hope.\nThe reality of the situation this week is that its not one thing that an incident can be attached to. Tam has been through a very difficult period in the last nearly two years. Things are starting to change. Expectations are changing. Life is having to move on. Plus Tam has complex needs.\nWednesday and Thursday have come down to 60% Tam has an infection (which I confirmed on Friday morning), 20% a change in the way he gets to school, 5% its his last week at school for half term, 5% christmas decorations are up in stores and people are talking about christmas, and a 10% of him being autistic and frustrated that these things are all happening plus other things that are important to him.\nUp until recently it has been much easier to apply a one problem to one reason kind of approach to understanding Tam. Now that I am plugging myself together again and the drugs are working much better so I am more capable I need to use this energy to help Tam in the most constructive way I can.\nAll of this leads me to the next set of thoughts that I have been having about Tam and how to bring him up best. Both me and Bev never shied away from fighting the battles we needed to fight for Tam and always accepted his autism from the day he had a diagnosis. At the same time we have always pushed Tam in ways to make his life better. Sometimes that was taking him to places that might upset him and keep taking him to them. Eventually he would settle and love those places is what we discovered. His ability to change and be resilient is something to behold. Further to that we also knew that some battles were best served with a surrender for now and a regroup to work out a better way of helping Tam.\nDuring these times I always kept two bits of advice that my mother used.\n 1. Be clear.\nIf you say to a child \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t run you will fall over\u0026rdquo; expect the child to fall over. It is the last thing the child heard. Instead say \u0026ldquo;you will fall over if you run\u0026rdquo;, the child will run and most likely not fall over. (try it - it works).\nMy Mam\n  2. Be timely.\nIt does not matter if a child does something wrong or wonderfully right, tell them straight away and if you cannot do it straight away then forget about it. Its simple, if the child has just done something and it then gets a reaction (good or bad) that will reinforce the situation. Child does something bad, the consequences are pretty much immediate in being told off, then that will offer an action to consequences idea in the child\u0026rsquo;s head. When something good happens the immediate praise reinforces the activity and more positive action will follow.\nAgain my MAm\n Now with Tam all of this advice needs to be turned up to 12 on the volume scale. Before I ask Tam to do something or I tell him what we are doing I carefully think about what I want him to know, what order the words need to be in and the tone of voice that will work best. It sounds like hard work but it is worth the effort.\nA good example of this was when Tam was soiling himself in the weeks following Bev\u0026rsquo;s death. It was so easy to get upset and angry with him. After all I was suffering with him. I was missing Bev and wondering how to look after Tam and myself with this massive hole in our lives. I know I raised my voice with him, I know I cried in frustration, I know how I angrily cleaned the walls and carpets. All of this did not help Tam or myself.\nNow during those early weeks I had a visit from Louise a nurse that came out to talk to us about Tam soiling himself. She gave me loads of good advice and placed the situation in my head that I just could not see in the moment. Tam was soiling himself because he was massively anxious. It was a moment of clarity that Tam was way too important to me and he was going through so much more than me. I modified everything on that day and have continued since. If Tam soils himself I keep my tone very monotone, my body language is slow and careful, and we work together to get cleaned up. Tam helps and comes for a hug when we are finished. It feels good, the best cuddle. He loses his anxiety, daddy is proud of how he helps and the (excuse my language) piss \u0026amp; shit is forgotten.\nSo my point is never forget all of the facets of autism. They are many and varied. Look at your child as a whole and do the percentages on what is affecting them. Go slow, listen to all of the clues and don\u0026rsquo;t worry about getting it wrong. Sometimes in being wrong you find the right answer.\n",

    "body": "It is all very easy to take what seem like small things for granted.\nEarly on after Bev died Tam had lots of issues and some of them started to occur on his way to school. Tam travels to school on a bus or taxi and requires an escort. This is all organised by SEN Transport at the Newcastle council.\nAfter one particularly bad situation on his way to school I asked to take over as his escort. This continued up until this week. Now he has an escort. I deliver Tam to the taxi and it is out of my hands. I pick him from the taxi after school. I was very worried about doing this but his new escort Claire has made it fuss free and Tam has just accepted the change.\nNow going from being his escort to just being his Dad has freed up nearly 2 hours for me. I am being responsible with that time and trying to make it work for both of us. I think I am having more separation anxiety than Tam is. All I will say is my separation anxiety keeps me company.\nThe point of this is that I have been given tons of support from the people at SEN transport and without their understanding, support, empathy and a little dose of righteous telling off to be good to myself, life would have been so much harder.\nIt is all too easy to disregard the things that appear to be simple and getting your child to school when they are showing really complex behaviour would be easy to just say to yourself, \u0026ldquo;well it just getting them to school\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;its there job, easy\u0026rdquo;. Well over my time talking to the people in SEN transport I learned a lot of things. One simple thing that still blows my mind is that every morning and night SEN transport are responsible for getting 1000+ kids to and from school. Each kid is different and has their very own complicated set of needs. Now to me that feels like an act of magic. Just think about it, 1000+ kids on the move with drivers, routes, escorts, kids off sick, parents not being there to meet their kids. Just think about that for one minute. I have.\nThank you SEN transport Newcastle, you are rare people, you all have huge heart and are much understood and undervalued. Angels one and all.\n",

    "body": "A change is as good as a rest, that\u0026rsquo;s a saying I have always appreciated in my life. Then life throws a change at you that you don\u0026rsquo;t want and it is anything but a rest. In fact it becomes the most heartbreaking, stressful and disturbing event of your life.\nFor the past year I have done everything I can to build a stable platform for mine and Tams life. A place to heal, a place to be miserable and a place to learn to live again. I have fought tooth and nail to protect Tam and protect our little existence. I have placed so much importance on the stability of that platform that any form of change has felt traumatic.\nGraham our taxi driver to school has been a constant for Tam and me since Bev\u0026rsquo;s death. Through thick and thin he has got us to school and me back home.\nToday I have started to change that. It is a small change but I am going to stop escorting Tam to school in the taxi. An escort has been organised called Claire. This morning was the first journey for Tam with her and me in support. I am only going to be with him this week to support Claire in getting to know Tam.\nAfter all of the worry I have had in the past week about this change it went off better than I could of hoped. Now Tam is not a trusting kid. He is very wary of strangers but when we got to school he grabbed Claire\u0026rsquo;s hand and give her a hug and got out of the taxi with her. And off he went to school. Could not have gone better.\nAll of a sudden Tam having an escort to school feels like a good space to be in. It might help with his separation anxiety. It might even help with my separation anxiety. It will help with our resilience.\nNext week it will start fully with me handing Tam off to Graham and Claire to get him to school.\n",

    "body": "One of the biggest steps I have taken with Tam is putting him into respite. So far it has been 1 or 2 nights in a lovely place that is especially for kids with autism. The staff are fantastic and do an excellent job of helping the kids to adjust to a new environment. I really could not ask for more from them.\nThe process of Tam going to respite has been a slow and careful approach to getting him comfortable with the centre and the staff. I have to admit at the beginning it was slow and a little frustrating but sitting hear now at 5am with Tam at the respite centre (and I have had a good nights sleep) I realise that the pace was right and the steps we took were right.\nNow all of the said its not perfect but that is nothing to do with the centre or the staff, its more to do with Tam. By saying its more to do with Tam take it that Tam and me are an inseparable entity. We affect each other so much. If he is upset I am, if I am down he is down.\nThis morning is the end of a 2 day stay at the centre. Its only his second 2 day stay at respite and he has had just over 10 nights there this year. When I told Tam he was staying at respite he became distant for a few minutes and sobbed. He absolutely sobbed. My heart broke. I explained that it was an adventure and he would be going to the park he loves. Nothing calmed him. I dropped him off at the respite centre and he was still crying but he went in. I am came home. My heart was powering like crazy. I got a call that he had been upset for a while but went to the park and was laughing and giggling.\nNow one of the most worrying part of his stays at respite is that he won\u0026rsquo;t eat. I have sent his favourite foods in with him but he ignores them. Now my little lad still has a lot of puppy fat so I am not really worried about him not eating while at respite as long as he drinks.\nAfter his first night in respite I went to pick him up to go to school and he was standing at the door waiting with his overnight bag. I explained to him that he had one more sleep and he needed to leave his bag. A squadron of Royal Marines could not have taken his bag off him and it was easier and less upsetting to take his bag with us. Off he went to school.\nThat afternoon, I picked him up and explained he had another sleep at respite and the sobbing and tears started again. Now earlier that day I had drawn a line that if he did not eat at school I would take him home. If he had eaten then respite. He had eaten, not much, but he had eaten.\nSame process, we got to respite and he went in still crying carrying his bag.\nRespite is important for both of us. I need to get rest and some solid sleep to recharge my batteries. In a typical week at the moment I will follow Tams routine of at least 2 nights with no sleep (i have to sleep during the day). Plus loads of other little things that can be difficult. Second part of respite is for Tam to get used to having other people around him. He will potentially need assistance for the rest of his life, so right now is the easiest time for him to get used to this situation.\nSo if someone was looking at putting there child into respite I would say, listen to the people in the respite centre. They are the experts in acclimatising kids into the service and making them feel comfortable. Then I would tell them to listen to themselves as they are the experts in their child. Finally be strong. Oh, last thing, when they are in respite don\u0026rsquo;t expect much of themselves for the first 10 visits, it will be very hard.\nA couple of hours and I will be picking up Tam. I hope that at least he had a good nights sleep.\n",

    "body": "I have spent quite a lot of time looking into any information that I can find on separation anxiety. Most of it is about the mental health aspect of it, some of it is about methods of coping with typical kids starting school or playgroups. Very little of it is about separation anxiety caused by grief. Either I am missing the point and it is inherent in the condition of grief and is taken as said or that not many people have looked at the situation.\nOver the past year and a half I have tried to keep Tam healthy with full knowledge that it is his mental state that is the issue that effects his physical health. His lack of consistent sleep is a major contributor to his tendency to lots of infections.\nRight now my concentrated effort is in finding a way for him to firstly understand the events that have rock his and my world in the worst possible way. Secondly find a way to get my confident little lad back. The difference between the pre-christmas 2017 Tam and the current Tam is painful. Never mind what I feel, it is far worse seeing my little lad suffer. Bev would want me to do everything to help him and now that I feel I have enough mental and physical strength that is what my one and only goal is.\nOf all the things that worry me about Tams mental health its his separation anxiety that is highest on the list. It manifests itself every night. It is part of the reason he has trouble sleeping. At the moment Tam is like my 3D shadow. If I leave the room he is in within seconds he follows me.\nSo I have started my own research into how to help Tam and I am trying to mould the findings into a plan that I can use. The problem arises with the level of communication that Tam has. He has too little verbal communication and its all around the things that are important to him. Just for clarity Tam might not be verbal himself but he understands a high level of communication. He can snoop on a phone conversation and know what is happening. Verbal in is good, verbal out is limited, so confirmation of verbal input is uncertain.\nNow searching google and taking everything as said is dangerous. One video I watched had a test that made sense but the presenter went on and on about talking to a medical professional about the situation. I will be talking to medical professional and asking for advice and also what resources are available.\nIt is worth listing out the questions from that one video that made sense. It is basically a test with 5 questions.\nQuestion 1.Do you worry about losing or harm coming to your loved ones?\nQuestion 2. Do you feel distressed when you are away from home or your loved ones?\nQuestion 3. Are you clingy around your loved ones?\nQuestion 4. Do you have nightmares about being away or leaving your loved ones?\nQuestion 5. When you are away from loved ones do you get physically sick?\nI cannot ask Tam these questions and get direct answers so I have to guess the answers from his behaviour and how it has changed. So basically it is a comparison between pre-christmas 2017 and now versions of Tam.\nAnswer 1. I don\u0026rsquo;t think Tam had a comprehension of harm or loss of me or Bev was possible. His behaviour now shows a level of panic if he cannot see me. If he wakes at night he will rush to find me shouting \u0026ldquo;Daddy, daddy\u0026rdquo;. If I am not in bed and he cannot find me immediately he will wet or soil himself and start into a meltdown. So answer 1 is YES.\nAnswer 2. Tam has two parts of his life that mean he is away from me. One is school and the other is respite. School has been a constant in Tams life and it is something he enjoys. He likes the process and structure that school brings and as soon as he is home he asks about school the next day. So as a measure its either a no to question 1 or not a valid indicator. Respite is another story. As a good for instance the last respite stay was on a Monday and Tuesday night. I told Tam on the Sunday that he was having 2 sleeps at repsite. Monday after school he started to get upset at seeing his overnight bag when he got in the taxi. However he went in without as much as a glance over his shoulder. He slept OK but had very little to eat. A few morsels of fish and some milk before bed. The next morning he cried in the taxi to school and would not let go of me. That afternoon after school he cried in the taxi all the way to respite and cried for a good while after. The next night at home he was welded to my side and kept blowing me kisses. So taking the respite situation into account I would change answer 2 to YES.\nAnswer 3. That\u0026rsquo;s the easiest question to answer its a definite YES.\nAnswer 4. Well Tam has had loads of nightmares and what appear to be dreams about Bev and also the scene he witnessed when she died. So a definite YES\nAnswer 5. This one is complicated as the distance involved can be very small that Tam soils himself at home. Away from home he cries for home and daddy. I am going to answer YES.\nSo 5/5 on the quiz. does not really teach me anything new but it gives me 5 directions to look for ways to help Tam.\nNext step is to talk to the doctors and see what advice they give.\n",

    "body": " empathy /ËÉmpÉÎ¸i/\nnoun: empathy\nthe ability to understand and share the feelings of another.\n A lot of my time at the moment is trying to see things from Tams point of view. Trying to understand what he is feeling, what is going through his mind, what is causing him to act a particular way. This is all with the hope of an outcome that I can do something to help him.\nTam has been through a lot. For a typical kid with verbal skills it would be a lot to process but their verbal skills would allow questions and answers, which would lead to a development of understanding of the events they saw.\nTo be specific in Tams case he was with me and Bev one minute waiting for a taxi, cuddling his mammy and the next minute being lifted off his mammy and watching her having CPR performed and then mammy being taken away. Then hours and hours in a hospital and then never seeing his mammy again. Then for days and weeks watching his daddy cry and having lots of strangers coming and going.\nSince all of that happened he has kind of expected that he continue the normal stuff and I have little clue about how much he understands. I know he misses his mummy a load, I know he cries for his mummy. It is only through being present and listening to his language of doing and being that I will ever get to understand him and what he is going through.\nOn a bad day I think he has forgotten his mummy and because of his limited experience he maybe thinks it is normal. Maybe he thinks people just come and go. I cry on those days. Then on a good day he does things that shows me he is missing mammy and that he loves her with ever fibre of his body. I cry on those days as well.\nOver the past year and 9 months we have made progress. Tam at times will be looking at the pictures on the memory wall and he will grab me and press my throat to ask me to speak and tell him stories about each photo. This leads to an hour together just sharing memories of when each photograph was taken. At that moment we share our love and empathy for each other.\nUntil recently while Tam has made progress and I have tried to make my own progress, he can fall back into a pattern of behaviour that makes it fell like things are going to be like this forever. At these times I remind Tam of all the things I would tell a child who would communicate and wait for the time when we move forward again. Its about all I can do.\nThere is one part of Tams behaviour that has stayed pretty constant and that is separation anxiety. At best he has to know where I am and will follow me if I get up to do something. I worst he is like a 3D shadow that has to be in physical contact with me all of the time. Just to be clear all of the time means when I great from school until (if I am lucky) he falls asleep or goes back to school the next day. Sometimes my arm is sore from him nipping me if I move to far.\nSo what is my point? I think my point is that no matter who you meet in your life never jump to conclusions about a person and their actions. Watch them, communicate with them, ask them if they are ok or can you help them before painting their behaviour with a label. I see far too many people painting Tam and me with labels and if they stopped and showed some empathy they might get more out of their day, or least they would just move along and mind their business. Neither me or Tam want peoples pity, we just want to get on with our lives and rebuild. So be more empathetic to the people around you, you life will be richer for it.\n",

    "body": "On any day of the week when Tam comes in from school he follows a very prescribed path of tasks and objectives.\nFirst he gives me his coat, I get eye contact and he is off and getting his iPad. Next he strips down to his pants and after a few minutes of getting what he wants playing on his iPad he picks his clothes up and puts them in the washing machine. God help me if it is running or just finished a cycle and I have forgotten to empty it. Its an immediate meltdown.\nNext he asks for milk and he get snuggled on the sofa feet in the air, iPad propped between his knees and drinks his milk. All is calm for about 20 minutes.\nAfter the calm things stay calm but the organisation begins. If I am not seated in the right place or I am pottering around Tam will come and get me and place me in the right place (he makes me sit where Bev used to sit). Then comes the blinds, he pulls the blinds down and switches the lights on. First the little desk light and then the main lights. At this point he gives a little tell about what he is feeling. If he dims the lights its going to be a quiet night. The amount of dimming can tell loads of stories. If the light is turned on, dimmed and then off with only the desk light left on then I know Tam is going to be ill.\nOut of what I have described so far the only thing that makes Tam anxious is if he cannot get me to stay seated or if I get a phone call during this time. If either of those things happen then we enter a dis-regulated state for a couple of hours. So I have to make sure I have things all ready for my incarceration.\nTam at this point settles and has about an hour of iPad time. He is happy and content during this time as long as everything is in the right place.\nNow I ask you a little favour. Just put yourself in a seat in your living room. Imagine the curtains or blinds drawn, it does not matter if its damp and grey or a beautiful blue sky, the blinds are closed. You have artificial light switched on and you cannot leave that seat for an hour. Multiply that by five and then by the 40 weeks or whatever it is for a school year. The consequences of not maintaining that are pain for your child. Ok, now relax.\nNow in recent weeks there has been an addition to this regime. About 8pm Tam will pull up the blinds like the night is over, switch the lights off and ask for a snack. So now from having the outside world and light shut out we are plunged into darkness. Over the past few weeks I have learned that this is Tam telling me he does not want to go to bed and he is ready to get ready and go to school.\nTonight is the first night I have not pushed the bedtime process. All I have done is talk to him about sleep and after sleep is school and yes he is going to assembly. All I got back was tears and \u0026ldquo;scared to sleep\u0026rdquo;. At the point he told me that he looked honestly terrified. I managed to calms him down by making a nest on the sofa beside me and that where he is right now. Head rested against my ribs and once again chilled out watching Alvin \u0026amp; the Chipmunks. Apart from the glow of the laptop screen and iPad we are in darkness. He looks so beautiful in the iPad light.\nSo we have another long night. I will gently ask him about going to bed, and will test the waters carefully, but I will not push it as it is not worth the scratches, kicks and bites that I will receive by pushing him to go to bed.\nIf tonight follows the trend of the past weeks I will be carrying him to bed sometime between 4 and 6am. I will then be waking him at 8am and getting him ready for school. By the time we are pulling into school he will be trying to get out of the taxi and running into school with a big smile. I don\u0026rsquo;t know how he does it.\nWithout the ability and language to be able to talk to Tam I cannot know for sure what is going on inside his complicated head. All I know is that this set of actions and his scared to sleep started on Bev\u0026rsquo;s birthday, it has got worse in the last week and when I push it for Tam to go to bed it becomes what I can only describe as violent. So for now it is a situation that will exist until it stops.\nSleep well and dream nice dreams,\nAlan \u0026amp; Tam\n",

She is not seeing her precious boy grow up.\nI decided that today I was going to keep Tam busy with lots of little presents and one big present along with his favourite food.\nIt did not work.\nTam has been so wound up since he got home. He has told me \u0026ldquo;miss mammy\u0026rdquo; so many times and has kissed her photo so much. He is so frustrated tonight he wants nothing to do with food, or his presents. I have had to hide them because he got so angry and I had to wrap around him to stop him hurting himself.\nI know time will heal us both and he will understand how much he is loved by both me and mammy. His speech will improve so that he can have a discussion about what happened. But, and its a huge but, right now his frustration and anger are front and centre for him. I am just thankful that the four or five explosions that he has had have been defused by kisses and hugs.

He is inconsolable when I wake him and sobs and will not allow me to hug him or even touch him. I will have that to deal with when he runs out of steam. Right now he is absolutely shattered and fighting sleep like a trooper.\nI understand him being scared of sleep if he is having such nightmares and have to support him through this. We had made so much progress and this is a bump in the road of grief.\nHe is jammed up against me as I write this and if I move away he follows me and needs a tight hug. I have not been more than a few centimetres away from him since 11 am yesterday. Grief and nightmares are hitting him hard.\nI do my best to reach him. I keep my tone of voice positive, I accept his separation anxiety and work with him to reduce it. I praise all things he does to be more content. I use a neutral voice when I am telling him not to do something he shouldn\u0026rsquo;t or to ask him to be quiet.\nI tell him that we need to go to bed and sleep. I try to bribe him with going to the pictures and he talks about it all day. I tell him we cannot go to the pictures if we don\u0026rsquo;t go to sleep. None of it works.\nIf I put him to bed and stay with him he just does not settle and becomes more disregulated until it becomes violent. I do not like him being violent so I quit before we get there. That might seem like bad parenting but when Tam lashes out it is unrestrained and being scratched, kicked and punched by your son because he is scared to sleep is not worth it. Better to call a halt and keep things calm. We will get past this.\nPart of me blames myself for giving in and putting a film on with the lights off. Maybe the atmosphere when we do this gives Tam reason to kick off knowing that he is getting a prize of time watching a film with dad. But I see the terror on his face when he is tired and falling asleep and kicks himself into action to fight the sleep and the terror that follows. Using the word TERROR might feel melodramatic and full of drama but honestly it is terror on his face when he realises that he is falling asleep. It breaks my heart to see the look in his eyes and the stress on his beautiful face.\nI have tried to put myself in his place. Imagine I had seen my dad giving CPR to my mam when I was 10 years old. Then we arrive in hospital and all kinds of things are happening that I had not experienced before. And finally I never see my mam again. For a child that can communicate and ask questions and listen to answers it would be hard enough. It would have scared me for life and I think I would have been a very different person. Being brought up by my Dad would have definitely made me a different person.\nI cannot quite remember how old I was but my mam went into hospital to have her gall bladder removed and I had to stay with an aunt. I am still scared by that. I cannot imagine how scared I would have been if she never came home again.\nTime will heal both of us. We will always have a huge hole in our lives. We will be very different from the alternates if Bev was still alive. But we will heal and Tam will sleep without nightmares, well at least not this often.\nSo the sun is coming up and its time to make Tam something to eat. One of the weird things of being up all night is that you have to treat the time as if its a normal day and eat and drink. Just because you should be sleeping does not mean that food and sustenance are not needed.\nHope you all slept well and shame you missed the peachy sunrise.\n",

    "body": "I decided I was going to review the month of September half way through and again at the end. I put this on my to-do list months ago and I have forgotten why. All I can think is that I did it for a reason so here goes.\nTwo birthdays have passed, Bevs and mine. They were really difficult days, grief grabbed me by the shoulders wrestled me to the ground and then gave me a bloody good kicking. I cannot even put into words how much I miss Bev. Then after grief had finished with me and I got busy with Tam it did the same to him. He misses his mummy so much and showed it front and centre on her birthday. Tams grief in some ways is typical, in some ways it is so very different. Over the days since Bevs birthday Tam has been what I will call triggered. He is very easy to anger, and he is very prone to breakdowns where he sobs until he is sick.\nThis week Tam had a night in respite and he refused food and drink. I know what Tam can be like and it is very frustrating and worrying when he refuses food and drink. Normally he refuses drink when he is ill. He even dumps drinks when he is given them and does not want to drink. In this case I know it is how he has been feeling and a psychological thing rather than a physical problem. I am going to have to work with the respite centre to get him eating better there as he starts staying for more than one day very soon.\nI had a visit to the doctors, it was a very useful evaluation of things and I have a better way forward as far as me. I am not going to say any more than that as I have to focus on Tam and make sure he feels safe and secure.\nSo Tam in the past couple of weeks has regressed as far as his separation anxiety goes. He is back to having bad dreams and wetting the bed real bad. Last night I had to change him and the bed clothes twice and I spent the night watching over him as he was screaming in his sleep. He is also crying for his mammy, all of this breaks my heart.\nSeptember at the half way point has been a really difficult month and I have Tams birthday to sort out. It is such a sad time as I remember last year and he got so angry with his presents he pretty much destroyed them all. I only have a few days to decide how to do this and I have no clue which is the best thing to do.\nAll I can hope is that we get through September and work through the christmas period which is another rough time for both me and Tam. The shops will have christmas decorations and that kind of rules out taking Tam to town as he reacted so badly last year.\n",

    "body": "September is a month of birthdays. Bevs on 10th, Mine today 12th, and Tams on 24th. It used to be a fun month, now wrapped in grief.\nGrief for my soul mate not been here to make a fuss of, grief for my son not having his mammy to fuss over him, and grief of not having someone to share my birthday with. To be honest I have never been bothered about my birthday, the biggest part of my birthday was talking to my mam and wishing her a happy birthday. She did all of the hard work.\nSo I am writing this sitting in a tea room waiting for a full english breakfast as a treat to myself. Tam is safe at school after a very tearful night. Its time to take a breath, time to breathe.\nI knew that these few days would be difficult, I just did not guess on how crushing the grief would be. The surprise has been Tam. His grief really came into perspective over the last few days. With Tam being mostly non verbal it is always difficult to process what is going on with him either physically or emotionally. Well I can be in no doubt about his emotional state. He sang happy birthday to a photo of his mammy with no prompting or discussion, he has cried for mammy for the last few days and this morning the first thing he did was come across and say happy birthday and give me a crushing hug. I am so proud of my boy and the only thing I wish is that I could reach him easier.\nSo breakfast eaten and it was very good. Service excellent, full english breakfast excellent, carrot cake excellent, Happy Birthday to me. If you are in Newcastle I would recommend very highly the Quillaim Tea Rooms opposite the Civic Centre at the Haymarket end of Percy Street.\nOff for a walk and a little bit of shopping, we are out of waffles and Tam is loving waffles at the moment.\nThanks for reading\nAlan \u0026amp; Tam\nPS http://www.quilliambrothers.com\n",

    "body": "Today is an angry day, tomorrow is a sad day. Grief knows how to really punch you in the gut around birthdays.\nSeptember 10th would have been Bevs birthday. Sorry, reword that September 10th IS Bevs birthday.\n  Birthday Girl\n  Every year I have been lucky enough to celebrate her birthday with her it has always started at one minute past midnight. Little hints dropped by her about what presents she have. It was always a joke on about having to wait till the morning or evening. I always gave in with the presents that I got her, and she would get most within about 20 minutes of her starting to drop hints. Her presents from Tam had to wait for him coming back from school.\nI always tried to make it a bit of a laugh as far as birthday presents went and I am not sure when but cotton buds and pads became the daft present. I would spend time disguising and wrapping them. FOr days before Bev would go on about not needing more buds but she would laugh so loud when she opened them. I even held them back one year and she looked so disappointed when there were no cotton buds and pads. Again she laughed so much when I give them to her.\nHer not being here for her birthday is such a big hole.\nBoth me and Tam miss her everyday but her birthday is so hard. It is brimming full of memories. It is so sad for our boy. For the past few days he has been waking during the night singing \u0026ldquo;happy birthday to mammy\u0026rdquo;. I wish I could see inside his head. Bev always made such a fuss of Tam but more so on birthdays.\nShe would have been 51 years old. She was no age. She still had so much left to give and so much life to live.\nAnyway if you are reading this please hunt down a track from Alterbridge call \u0026ldquo;In Loving Memory\u0026rdquo; and play it.\n  The lyrics are :\n Thanks for all\nYou\u0026rsquo;ve done\nI\u0026rsquo;ve missed you for so long\nI can\u0026rsquo;t believe you\u0026rsquo;re gone\nYou still live\nIn me\nI feel you in the wind\nYou\u0026rsquo;ve got me constantly\nI never knew what it was to be loved\nThanks for all you\u0026rsquo;ve done\nI\u0026rsquo;ve missed you for so long\nI can\u0026rsquo;t believe you\u0026rsquo;re gone and\nYou still live in me\nI feel you in the wind\nYou guide me constantly\nI never knew what it was to be alone, no\n\u0026lsquo;Cause you were always there for me\nYou were always home waiting\nBut now I come home and I miss your face\nSo smiling down on me\nI close my eyes to see\nAnd I know you\u0026rsquo;re a part of me\nAnd it\u0026rsquo;s your song that sets me free\nI sing it while I feel, I can\u0026rsquo;t hold on\nI sing tonight \u0026lsquo;cause it comforts me\nI carry the things that remind me of you\nIn loving memory of the one that was so true\nYou were as kind as you could be\nAnd even though you\u0026rsquo;re gone\nYou still mean the world to me\nI never knew what it was to be alone, no\n\u0026lsquo;Cause you were always there for me\nYou were always home waiting\nBut now I come home and it\u0026rsquo;s not the same, no\nIt feels empty and alone\nI just can\u0026rsquo;t believe you\u0026rsquo;re gone\nAnd I know you\u0026rsquo;re a part of me\nAnd it\u0026rsquo;s your song that sets me free\nI sing it while I feel, I can\u0026rsquo;t hold on\nI sing tonight \u0026lsquo;cause it comforts me\nI\u0026rsquo;m glad it sets you free from sorrow\nBut I\u0026rsquo;ll still love you more tomorrow\nAnd you\u0026rsquo;ll be here with me still\nAll you did you did with feeling\nAnd you always found a meaning\nAnd you always will\nAnd you always will\nAnd you always will\nAnd I know you\u0026rsquo;re a part of me\nAnd it\u0026rsquo;s your song that sets me free\nI sing it while I feel, I can\u0026rsquo;t hold on\nI sing tonight \u0026lsquo;cause it comforts me\nAlterbridge\n Bev and Tam used to dance to this and I used to watch in awe. It used to light up my world. Now I hear it sung from Tams point of view and it makes me so happy to have had the honour of spending so many year with her.\nAfter dancing\nSweetheart we miss you so much.\nAlan and Tam\n",

    "body": "Tam went back to school today. He was real confused this morning. After thousands of times asking \u0026ldquo;going to school tomorrow\u0026rdquo; he was getting ready for school. It caused a little bit of panic as he had to get some things in place ready for him leaving. All weird stuff like his star projector has to be facing a certain way in his bedroom. He has to use his iPad and Kindle to watch particular things in the morning. He has to have his chair sideways when he gets his breakfast. All weird stuff but it makes him happy.\nOff to school we went, no drama, no complaints, eager to get out of the taxi when we get there. Out of the taxi lots of new faces around him and away he went without any trepidation. So proud of his resilience in these situations. He loves school so much.\nAll of the worry was wasted energy. We did it, we got back to school with no fuss or drama.\nHomeward bound and thoughts of Bev, so many wishes and no chance of them coming true.\nI spent the next few hours being busy getting tidied up, put some music on, totally random but \u0026ldquo;The Specials\u0026rdquo; is great music to keep the energy level high. If I stopped I knew I would have grief dropping on me hard so I cracked on. I needed to get tidy again.\nOne part of today that I had decided was important was that I was going to be good to myself. So I set myself some simple tasks and got on with them, then I sat down with a cup of tea and some toast. The grief settled heavy, grief for my little boy losing his mother who would have been fussing so much today, grief for my soul for losing the love of my life. Grief for the fact that me and Tam would never be the same again and would always have a huge hole in our lives that will never be filled.\nThen when all of that started to wash away I started to think about the holiday and whether they had been a success or not. Now based on the plans I had for us, the answer is that they were a massive failure. However, when looking at the place we started the holiday and how we ended the holiday I started to realise that we had had some good success\u0026rsquo;s.\nFor one Tam started the holidays with lots of health problems, over the holidays I think that Tam is physically more healthy. His mental health is still not great, he still has major issues with sleeping. Bad sleep for Tam is 3 days and nights with NO SLEEP. Good is 2-6 hours sleep. All of the shades of grey in between which can include him getting a bit violent. All of this comes to down to Tams perspective of seeing his mammy fall asleep and not coming back. He is scared and sometimes terrified to sleep. It is something I have to approach from his point of view and also make every effort to help him with.\nOh, I forgot we went through chicken pox as well during the holidays.\nOutings were few and far between, attempts were plenty but all but a few where failures. Looking now at what happened maybe it was more important for Tam to just be himself and spend time together. I know he feeds off how I am feeling and that is something we both have to work on. Spontaneity worked best over the holidays. Anything planned did not work well. Sometimes because of sleep, sometimes because of illness, sometimes because I was not feeling particularly emotionally strong and Tam picked up on it.\nAn example was that for a few days we talked about getting the train to Edinburgh Zoo. Tam likes the Zoo and train rides. All went well, Tam slept for about 4 hours and I had enough sleep to feel safe and not be worried that we ended up in Aberdeen. So off to the train station on the Metro. All good. We arrived at the train station tickets in hand and Tam had a massive meltdown. After about an hour I managed to put him over my shoulder and take him home. Its all he wanted to do, \u0026ldquo;Go home\u0026rdquo;.\nLooking at it then it was upsetting. I could not work out what went wrong. What had I done wrong. The planning, making food for the train and zoo was all done with no hitch, he seemed all up for it and something went wrong. The cost of the tickets was not the upsetting part. The upsetting part was that the only way I could help my boy was to take him home.\nNow I look at it and all think is that we tried. We were both safe and I was able to bring him down from his meltdown and do what he needed, take him home.\nTam had a good day at school. That is all that matters right now. Tam had a good day at school.\nThanks for reading\nAlan and Tam\n",

    "body": "Its the start of September and six weeks of holiday are nearly done. Only a few days left and a lot to do. Not least is to get Tam back into getting ready for school at the right time. That feels like an impossible tasks at the moment. Today is another day with no sleep. First of September and its 5am. No sleep. I have tried melatonin but he just got upset. I tried to keep him in bed but that became a fight. Right now he is wired, running around and aggravated. I am knackered and wondering when he will sleep. The only upside is that he is safe and fed.\nToday I tried to get his school clothes organised and have a bit of a tidy out. It caused all kinds of problems. Tam got very aggressive and upset. I had to call it off. There was a crazy idea that when I got him to sleep I would sort it out, look where that got me.\nAll I can do is hope that he falls asleep early tonight so that I can have a rapid sort out and then get some sleep. Hope is in short supply in this house, well as far as Tam sleeping. I have no clue how he does it. Maybe his autism allows for him to switch off half of his brain while the other goes at twice the speed.\nThree days and he is back to school and I am anticipating that I will be making apologies for his nature on his first day back. I half expect to be sending him to school with no sleep.\nI wish I understood what was going on in his brain. He seemed to be getting better, but all of a sudden he is scared to sleep again. He has told me umpteen times over the past week. I try to comfort him and make sure that he feels loved. I tell him he is loved, I show him love, we have kiss blowing games which make us both giggle. I wish I could take off this hurt for him. I wish I could change all of the bad things that have happened.\nAlan \u0026amp; Tam\n",

She was too young to go. I have stopped caring about my birthday. The thing I liked about my birthday was ringing my Mam at 7:30pm and wishing her a happy birthday, she did all of the hard work after all. All I can do is think about making that phone call. My biggest thing to do is to give Tam a great birthday and that is not easy when all I can think is that he does not have his Mammy here and the fuss she used to make of him.\nI always tried to make Bev\u0026rsquo;s birthday fun. I would get her lots of little presents and one big present. It became a bit of a joke that I always got her cotton buds and makeup pads. She would complain for days before saying \u0026ldquo;you better not have got me buds and pads\u0026rdquo; but laugh so loud when she unwrapped them. That laugh. My god she could fill a room with laughter. One year I hid the cotton buds and put them in her morning coffee cup when I left for work. I could hear the laughter in the text she sent.\nThe best I can do now is to put some flowers on her grave. Life is not right.\nSeptember is going to be a tough month. It has only just started and I am on day 3 of Tam not sleeping. I have anxiety about how I get him sorted for going back to school.\nAlso the damn shops and shopping centres will start putting up the Christmas decorations and last year the reminder of Christmas cause a lot of problems for Tam.\nI hate September.\nThanks again for taking time to read this\nAlan \u0026amp; Tam\n",

    "body": "Tam has had a few weeks of fairly decent sleep patterns. 2-6 hours of sleep. It\u0026rsquo;s funny what becomes decent.\nThe past few days have been terrible. It has taken another night of no sleep to re-evaluate that we are back in a section of life where Tam is once again scared of sleep. He told me last night again how he is \u0026ldquo;scared sleep\u0026rdquo;. He was so wound up he soiled and wet himself in bed. I though this was over. We had worked so hard to get him to the point of understanding that sleep is good and nothing to be scared of. I think maybe he is dreaming about the moments of Mammy being on the floor and her being left in hospital.\nLast night started off the right way. We started a countdown to bed, with an apple, bath, milk and ready for bed. We built our list of things to do for the next day. Tam wanted to go to the pictures (his favourite thing at the moment). Then into bed. I sat with him and all seemed to be well. Then he started to bounce on the bed. Now bouncing on the bed for Tam is he going from lying down to launching his body up (still in the lying position) and landing back on the bed to repeat. He some how gets some height. This escalates and he starts bouncing around the bed. Normally I can get him to stop with a stern voice, but not this time. He started thrashing. At this point I have to intervene in case he hurts himself by either falling of the bed or hitting the head board. So after a few minutes and a scratch on the nose I have him contained and start the process of talking to him quietly and hugging him close.\nGrabbing Tam when he is having a meltdown is never easy. He is big for his age and very strong. I have to wrap around him get behind him and wrap my legs around his and keep his arms down and hold him tight. At this point I have him safe but I have to be careful to control his arms and legs as they can lash out faster than Bruce Lee could throw a one inch punch. I also have to press my head close in to his head as the reverse head butt is painful to be on the receiving end of. Last night was one of those night that he was more difficult to get to a safe place and he got a couple of kicks and scratches in before I got him safe.\nAfter what felt like ages (probably 20-30 minutes) he started to calm down and stopped trying to thrash around. Careful use of the tone of voice and gentle but containing hugs are the most important tools in this situation. We were both sweating. After a little while longer I felt like it was safe to change position and get him into a more comfortable hug. We hugged for a while with him sitting across my legs and we both had a cry. At this point its better that we leave the bedroom and get something to drink and some calm time.\nSo 2:30am and we watched Green Lantern cartoons and had a cup of tea. Tam was still upset and it was at this point that he said he was \u0026ldquo;scared sleep\u0026rdquo;. He\u0026rsquo;s told me this before. He was either having nightmares, replays of Mammy dying, or just being scared of sleep. So we had the talk about how Daddy needs sleep, Tam needs sleep, everyone needs sleep. Mammy did not sleep, she died. She could not help leaving us, it\u0026rsquo;s what happens. It\u0026rsquo;s a totally heartbreaking conversation to have with him, but it\u0026rsquo;s the only way I can talk about sleep and his fear.\nSo it\u0026rsquo;s 3:45 after all of this and it\u0026rsquo;s time to try bed again. As soon as mention it an explosion occurs. Another hour or so to calm Tam down and another half an hour to get myself to calm. The sun is coming up. Another cup of tea and make Tam breakfast.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s now 6am and he is sitting tight next to me and watching childrens TV. I am typing this on my phone. It is not worth trying to get him to bed and sleep.\nNow though I have a problem, we are supposed to go to the cinema. The problem I have is that if I fall asleep in the cinema Tam could wander off. I think it will be safer and easier to just stay at home and go for a walk to the park later on. Not really a great holiday but I need to keep Tam and me safe.\nThe only thing I can do is to work towards tonight and see what that brings. Got to try to keep busy today. For now its peaceful and for that I am grateful.\nAlan and Tam\n",

    "body": "I have spent the past month trying to fill in the Disability Living Allowance (DLA) form for Tam. It is a horrendous form. Today I managed to finish it. I can hear you ask why did it take so long. Well it a little window into looking after an autistic, anxious, grieving boy.\nTam constantly wants and needs attention. Firstly to keep him safe. Even at home he could eat something that is non edible or bit a chunk out of something and get himself into difficulty very quickly. Secondly, if I am out of the room for too long (and that varies according to Tam) then he gets upset and starts banging around the room. He either throws himself against the furniture or starts to hit himself. Tam is \u0026ldquo;content\u0026rdquo; when I am sitting in a particular place (where Bev used to sit on the sofa) and doing no more than either watching him or reading on the kindle or phone. Anything else causes anxiety.\nI have tried to explain to him that sometimes I have to do something else. And I try to do that something else like fill in forms but he gets upset and it ends up with him getting a bit violent and trying to grab and break pens, paper or whatever I am trying to do. It then takes a while to calm him down. Now its not that I will give up trying to do these things with him. I will continue to try and at some point I hope that he will be ok with it.\nSo how have I managed to get a 40 plus page document down with Tam around? Well when I do manage to get him down and asleep I give myself 30 minutes to calm myself down. A part of that 30 minutes has been used to fill in a part of the form. Not every night not every day but when I could face the challenge. Anyone who has filled a DLA form out will know exactly what I am talking about. The form asks questions in the most insane of ways and asks for details that are no way connected to dealing with an autistic boy. The evidence that they ask for is ridiculous.\nSo to sum it up it is a bit by bit with a long laborious reread to make sure that everything is filled in correctly. Now the only thing left to do is post it.\nOnce posted it will be anxious wait to hear back from them. I always remember the first time this was done for Tam. We got turned down and had to raise a complaint to get a review done. A few weeks later we got a phone call saying that Tam would get DLA and that they could not understand why it was given a no in the first place. So the anxiety need to be locked away for a while and then wait and see.\nSleep well\nAlan and Tam\n",

    "body": "I wrote this ages ago and posted it on a forum about sharing grief. May as well include it here.\nLetter to the ones I have lost. Over A very short period of time I have lost the three most important people in my life. With my boy and me left we are finding a way to live life again. At various times I really look for solace or advice from each of them, and yes I do talk to them and imagine what their replies might be.\nAnyway I decided I needed to write to them. And this is what I wrote (its not what expected)\n I need to speak to the three most important people in my life.\nFirstly Dad, god I miss your wisdom and your love. I have so many things that I want to ask you about bringing Tam up. I want to feel your warmth and support that you used to give in the simplest of looks. I want to hear you pull me down just to build me back up so I can get things done.\nMam. I miss your love so deeply. The brightness in your eyes when I would open up to you. The worry while I was explaining what worries me. The conversations about Sydney harbour bridge. I wish I had your counsel right now. I need your insight into how to help Tam.\nLastly my one and only chosen love Bev. Your loss has torn me apart in a way that I will never be the same again. You where everything to me. Everything. You left so quickly and in such a horrible way I cannot ever get over it. One second I am talking to you and keeping our boy calm. And the next moment you are gone. Every waking moment I miss you and worry that I am letting you down. And letting our boy down. I still have not worked out which way to turn. I miss you soo much. We miss you so much.\nI am not sure what comes next for me and Tam. I have to work that out. I need to get a plan and from the plan the journey sweetheart. I will find a way to make you proud.\nI am not sure what happens after life. If it is just a reorganisation of your atoms then I hope that even just one atom from each of you nestles together in a molecule somewhere and becomes the building block of something new. That would be awesome.\nAlan\n Take care\nAlan and Tam\n",

    "body": "Over the past week I have had the opportunity to speak with some parents of children with varying special needs. The parents varied from a single parent like myself to normal families with help from siblings or the wider family. I used the opportunity to listen and also to share a little bit. It is all too easy to sound like a victim when talking about the situation that you find yourself in. I am especially aware that even writing this that I can come across as playing the victim. It is my hope that people realise that I am not trying to play the victim and that I am just talking about the situation that I find myself in.\nNow at times I find that the grieving comes on at the most unusual of times. For one when I dropped off Tam for his first night of respite the pain of grief was like a tidal wave. The one thing that surprised me was that some of the parents talked about the grief of looking after a disabled child. Neither me nor Bev have ever grieved for what might have been with Tam. Life gives and life takes away. Mother nature does what she does and that is it.\nWorry about the future was huge in everyone\u0026rsquo;s mind. But the bit that really got me was the way a couple of the siblings talked about the way they worried about their parents more than their disabled sibling. The maturity of these kids was incredible and it was an incredibly positive experience talking with them one to one.\nOne of the kids looked out for me and made a beeline for me as soon as he saw me. All he wanted to do was chew the fat. Talk about computers, electronics and sport were the main topics. The most telling part of the conversation was about worry, he wanted to know if being an adult was all about worry and stress. I tried to explain to him in the most positive way I could that unfortunately being an adult meant that you had to deal with worry about the people around you. The main point I tried to get over to him was that you could still keep the fun child inside and let them out at times. By the way he smiled when I gave him examples I think he understood.\nThe process of talking to the kid got me thinking more about Tams future, he was one year younger than the young man I had been talking to.\nThe outcome of meeting these people was that I admitted to myself that the situation that me and Tam are in is a tough one. Having no family that can help is what it is and is part of the package. So me and Tam have to work as a team, I have to look for help and support in a way that works for us. That support might take a while to formulate but it can be done. Right now I am going to try to stop worrying about tomorrow and just deal with today. If I can get to the end of day and feel like we did everything that we could then I can sleep (if Tam sleeps!!).\nThanks again for reading\nAlan and Tam\n",

    "body": "The Kubler-Ross definition of the stages of grief are listed as Denial, Anger, Bargaining, Depression and Acceptance. I understand the principle behind these stages but they are very much a simplification of the grieving process. Everyone grieves differently and the cause of the grief also causes the grief to rotate in different directions.\nI think when my Dad died I had more of the bargaining and acceptance and a lot less denial and anger. The fact that he was in his 90\u0026rsquo;s and that his health had not been great for a while made it easier to accept. He was tired and had earned the rest. I had anger aimed in a different direction.\nMy Mam\u0026rsquo;s death was over a longer period of time as she had dementia. Most of the time she would recognise me but then tell me about things that could not have happened. It was a heartbreaking situation that my proud mother was disappearing on a daily basis. One thing that really ripped me apart inside were the moments of lucidity that she had. Her frail thin face would fatten out, her eyes would sparkle for a moment and she would say my name. Then terror would appear in her eyes. She knew that something was very wrong. This would lead to the words that broke my heart over and over again and caused me to have multiple breakdowns. I ended up in medical care, I felt useless.\nBev was pulling me out of this. She could see my pain and I think she felt my pain. Lots of things that happened after my Dad died up to my Mam dying had caused me a multitude of problems which she did not understand at first but got a handle on it when I eventually broke down.\nI am not going over my stages of grief from the loss of Bev, that is for another time. I am more interested in talking about how Tam is processing his grief.\nEarly on I could not understand what Tam was feeling. His behaviour at times was normal, at other times is was totally abnormal for him. Even now I look at Tam and wonder what he feels or understands about what has happened. On a bad day I have this feeling that he does not even remember Mammy. I know that\u0026rsquo;s probably horrible to think but when he is not that verbal it is very difficult to understand what is going on in his brain. Things have happened with Tam that makes me realise that he misses his Mammy and they have happened more and more recently. His latest was to say to me \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t cry for Mammy\u0026rdquo;. I wish I knew where these things came from.\nIf I had to guess where Tam is on the stages of grief I would say we are in the hybrid of denial and anger. He still gets angry when he has to sleep sometimes. He has repeated many times over \u0026ldquo;scared sleep, mammy sleep, mammy gone\u0026rdquo;, something that I have tried to correct by explaining that mammy did not sleep. Further to this he gets anxious about things that before Bev died he would happily do. Part of the reason for this is to do with the fact that every time me and Tam went out I would do the we do this then that. Eventually our list would come down to we go to the coffee shop and then we go home to see Mammy. Now I think when we go out Tam thinks about that last thing we always did. We worked our way through our list of things to do with the final part being going home to see Mammy which no longer happens.\nThe process I have just outlined led to Tam actually talking more and he would stop me and say \u0026ldquo;get cake and cuppa and go home and see Mammy\u0026rdquo;. It was such an important part for Tam. It is heartbreaking for both of us that we no longer go home and see Mammy.\nAnyway the thought that I was having is that most of the research into grief does not take into account children or adults with learning difficulties. I cannot see that some of the standard stages of grief applies to Tam. I think I would change the stages to confusion, anxiety, new routine, denial and I want to say depression but I am still not sure if I could recognise this in Tam.\nOne thing I do know is that both mine and Tam\u0026rsquo;s health have suffered. Tam has been through all kinds of situations with his health. A lot of it caused by his lack of sleep, some from anxiety, some of it is historical.\nSo with all of that said, where are we now? Well we have a new routine. I work hard to make Tam feel safe, secure and loved. He does the same for me. Worry is constant about Tam every moment of the day and Tam reflects my moods back at me. I try to decypher what is going on with Tam and I listen to the things he says and the things he does. Tams anxiety is still at a very high level, he needs loads of love and affection as well as attention. Moments of relaxation are few and far between. We move forward.\nWhat scares me most? The most scary thought is that Tam forgets about his beautiful Mammy. I don\u0026rsquo;t understand how Tams brain works. How does his memory work in relation to thinking about his Mummy? I have no idea. I am sitting watching him right now, its 3pm in the afternoon and he is asleep because he is not well. He used to wake up screaming for his Mammy when he did sleep. He rarely does it now, in fact he has cried more because as he has told me \u0026ldquo;no Mammy in dream\u0026rdquo;. So much of what Tam is going through is heartbreaking for me. I have very little time for my own grief.\nAll of this ramble was me trying to work out what Tams process of grief is. I think he still has confusion, anxiety, denial and depression in varying percentages on any given day. I have depression on that list because it is what I would expect to happen more than I have evidence of it happening. We are building new routines. We are building the strength together to try new things. I accept failure in the things we try as we also have successes in the things we try.\nThank you for your time and I hope some of this makes sense.\nAlan and Tam.\n",

    "body": "I was not one of those kids that hated school, For me school was boring and the teachers struggled to keep me interested. Tam however loves school. It gives him the structure and engagement that he needs. Now matter how hard I try it is difficult to keep up the level of engagement that school gives him.\nToday we are roughly half way through the summer holiday and so far Tam has not missed a day or waking hour where I have not had the question \u0026ldquo;going to school?\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;going to school tomorrow?\u0026rdquo;. Sometimes it is asked 10 times in 5 minutes. I wish I could get a Â£1 for every time he asks. Maybe he is expecting a Â£1 from me every time he asks?\nAfter trying a whole raft of things including setting up a mini school with white board and timeline for us to follow I have discovered that it is a very poor relation of going to school. The fact is that when I try to set up a mini classroom it just frustrates and confuses him. (he\u0026rsquo;s just asked \u0026ldquo;yes going to school\u0026rdquo;)(and again this time twice even though I answered \u0026ldquo;no you are not going to school\u0026rdquo;)(add another one)\nSo far I have been writing this for 9 minutes and we are up to 4 asks. I am not kidding when I say that this goes on all day. It really goes on all day. It is also not just me he asks. He will ask random people. If I had to give an estimate I would probably say a thousand times a day, but in reality it might feel like that but its probably about 100-200 times a day. Multiply that the number of days since the school broke up and we are well over 1000 times.\nIf anyone has any ideas on how to solve this problem I am very willing to listen and try whatever advice that you can give. I show Tam a calendar every time I can to try to help. Right now I am right out of ideas. We try to stay busy but it never stops him asking \u0026ldquo;going to school tomorrow\u0026rdquo;. (add another ask)\nThe funny part is that the last couple of days of the holidays will be the ones that he does not ask. Go figure.\nThanks for reading\nAlan \u0026amp; Tam\n",

    "description": "",
    "body": "Over the past two couple of years I have kept a log of Tams sleeping patterns. It is part of a larger journal that I write in everyday. I write the challenges, the wins, what\u0026rsquo;s worrying me and lots of other things. The contents of the journal is not something that I would be willing to share as a whole but one section of it has been very useful.\nThat section is Tams sleep time. At first it listed out when Tam went to bed, how long me and Bev spent with Tam. Also what time he went to sleep and finally when he woke up. We used this information to help us to work out the right things to do to help Tam to be calm and sleep quickly. To a degree the information contain in the journals showed that Tam had patterns but any interference in those patterns did more harm than good. We did however see that the pattern that we had accidentally fallen into was actually working. The length of time we were spending getting Tam to sleep had reduced by about 15 minutes over 2 months. Now to some parents that might sound like much, especially when it was taking from 7:30pm until after 10:00pm to get Tam to sleep but to be honest that 15 minutes meant everything. It was 15 extra minutes to relax together.\nAfter Bev died the sleep log started to have a different meeting. The month after Bev died Tam was sleeping on average 8-10 hours per week. I know that that does not sound right but I checked the log and also lived through it. At times he would go for 3 days with no sleep, I repeat NO sleep.\nThis has changed over time to Tam sleeping for around 30-32 hours a week. Again this is not as much as he should but for now it is much better than it has been. Those averages are good news for me as over the past 18 months or so his sleep has improved. During that time the worries I have had about his health and at times about my own have been huge. For sure Tams health has taken a hit, but also his sleep patterns have been disturbed due to what he saw when his mummy died. It\u0026rsquo;s a vicious cycle.\nA while ago when sleep was real bad I sat and pleaded with Tam to sleep. I was super worried about his health. He was coming down with cold after cold and was all spotty on his face. He looked so pale. That night he told me the most important thing that he could have. He said \u0026ldquo;scared sleep, mammy sleep, mammy gone\u0026rdquo;. To Tam that was what he saw. He saw his mammy with closed eyes in a hospital bed and never saw her again. He did not want to sleep and he did not want daddy to sleep.\nFrom that started a long hard road of healing was the only way to fix Tams sleep. Nothing else would work. I had to be really honest with him. I had to work with him so that he knew that mammy did not go to sleep, so that he knew that mammy died. Using language about going to heaven and mammy being gone does not help. The concept of death is hard enough to explain without adding the religious element or the soft language to it.\nAs to other worries, all you have to do is look at any academic paper about sleep deprivation to see that it is very bad for your long term and short term health. Tam has been at times very spotty, he has suffered from bacterial and virus infections one after another. He has looked pale and pasty even when he has been out in the sun. It has and still is a constant worry. Just look at the NHS advice on lack of sleep and how it can effect your health.\nhttps://www.nhs.uk/live-well/sleep-and-tiredness/why-lack-of-sleep-is-bad-for-your-health/\nI was getting by. Sleep while he was at school was my way of supporting myself and Tam. Problem lies in that sleeping during the day meant that I got very little done. The nights were long and the days were not productive.\nBack to the sleep log. It has been a help in seeing that Tams sleep pattern is slowly getting better. It would have been all too easy with that record of feeling like nothing was changing. It has also helped in understanding the little changes that have helped. Finally it has helped in seeing the value of various drugs that have been prescribed to help Tam sleep. It was not easy giving him drugs, I felt like I was failing him when I did but with support from Doctors I got over this. Some of the drugs work some of the time and some work all of the time. Drugs that work all of the time are used sparingly to ensure Tam gets one good nights sleep.\nNow the summer holidays have started Tams sleep patterns have changed again. We seem to have been alternating between 2 and 6 hours sleep every night. Only 1 night with no sleep, but that was because of an event that brought lots of thoughts about mammy to the front again. I have given Tam a break from the drugs for the first week of the holidays and for this week I am going to use them when they are needed.\nTo summarise this rambling up. If you have a child or you yourself have problems sleeping make a journal of the events in your life. List out the things you do before bed. Make notes on when you sleep, what kind of sleep, dreams, waking events and any kind of event that occurs during this time. Build it up over time and then read over it. Don\u0026rsquo;t stress about it, give it time. The journal will help you assess if there is anytime or anything that might be different in helping you sleep.\nI feel like what I have written is a bit of a mess but I am posting it and will look at it again in the next few days. I am a bit sleep deprived at the moment and my thoughts are a little muddled.\nSleep the best you can and let your dream come true.\nAlan and Tam\n",

    "date": "",
    "description": "",
    "body": "As all parents of autistic kids know getting a haircut for their child can be a nightmare. The smells and noises of a barber or hairdresser shop can be overwhelming. It is not a good experience for anyone involved unless you find a smart, compassionate and patient soul to help with the situation. We did and this is the story.\nBefore Bev died we had a process at bathtime for Tam and like a trooper he followed it with us. It would start with telling Tam it was bathtime soon and following a bit of a countdown. Then I would start running the bath and Tam would get in. He did not like getting into a full bath and instead liked to have the water running. Next stage was a hair wash, it either happened first or did not happen and bathtime descended into a fight. Hair washed and the normal play and wash time continued. Tam would pull the plug when all finished to his satisfaction and stay in the bath until all of the water had gone. Daddy time of drying down. So a clear demarcation of duties that Tam understood was that daddy does the bathtime and mammy did the hair time.\nTam would then go an sit with mammy and patiently allow her to brush his hair and even trim his fringe when needed. It was not without problems but Bev manged the situation beautifully. I would sometimes just watch the two of them as they had a peace in the process that had magic in it. The fact that Tam was so chilled most of the time unless mammy caught a tot in his hair and pulled to hard. Looks would be exchanged and kisses and they would carry on. Some nights Bev would sit playing with Tams hair for hours with him just chilled allowing it to happen and sometimes giggling because it got tickly.\nNow that might sound great and peaceful, and it was while Bev was here to play her part. One thing you might have noticed in the picture I have posted is that Tam has long hair in some and short hair in others, well that is the part of this story that I will now explain. Up to now its been setting the scene.\nOver the years of trying to get Tams hair cut, we got lazy or we just decided it was not a fight worth fighting. You have to pick your battles and we had plenty other stuff that was more important. Time passed and Tams hair got longer and longer.\n  Mini Thor with Mammy\n  We loved Tam with his long hair. He was our \u0026ldquo;surfer dude\u0026rdquo; and Bev liked him because he had hair like Thor in the Marvel movies. (yes she liked Thor, its the only reason she watched Marvel movies) So Tam had long hair and it was not going anywhere. It was his thing.\nAfter Bev died the process of having a bath tried to stay true to the past but Tam would not let me brush his hair the way Bev did. I even found a video of her doing it and tried to follow what she was doing. It was no good. The school even tried. Nobody could do it like Bev, no one could do it like mammy.\nOver a short amount of time his hair became more and more unruly. It was a fight that me and Tam had that was upsetting for both of us. I hated the thought of cutting his hair because Bev loved it long. She was her little \u0026ldquo;Thor\u0026rdquo;.\nOne day a friend pointed out that Thor had short hair now. They even showed me the scene in Thor:Ragnarok. All we needed was Stan Lee and his contraption and we would be home free.\nA few days later we were having our late shopping visit in town. Tam wanted a DVD. I needed to get some money and used a cash point right near a barbers. The Original Barber Shop on Blackettbridge. Only one person getting their hair cut and no one waiting. The barber sitting waiting for a customer was covered in tattoos and had a man bun as I remember. I only wish I could remember his name. We went to talk to him and I explained Tam was autistic and this might be real difficult. He was so chilled and cool and spoke to Tam. So we went for it.\nNow everything in a barbers shop is a trigger. The music, scissors, buzzing clipper, hair dryers. Everything is a trigger. So we went slowly. The barber was very patient and we decided it was better for Tam to sit on my knee and for me to hold his hands. As he progressed to take a look at Tams hair the problem came to light. Underneath his long hair were dreadlocks. They would have to be combed out before it could be cut.\nWith the guy and another hairdresser they spent 2 hours patiently working away. I had a hold of Tam. He was sweating and I was sweating. Tam was humming and struggling but he was mostly still. In one sense it felt like an eternity but on another sense it was over in a moment. Tam had a new short easy to maintain haircut and he still looked like Bev\u0026rsquo;s little Thor. He looked so grown up.\nShort Hair\nI am not ashamed to say I cried during the process, I had loads of flashbacks to our conversations about Tams hair. I just had loads of flashbacks.\nThe barber rang up the till and asked for like Â£10, the price they charged for a haircut. This had been no normal haircut. Both him and his collegue had been patient and respectful of Tam and me. Giving him Â£10 would have been ridiculous. I gave him Â£50, it was all I had on me. It was still not much above minimum wage in my calculation but it at least showed him my gratitude for what was a difficult and sweaty two hours work.\nNow that day I was lucky. Tam was actually really good. The sweaty nature of the event was his stress coming out. The fact he actually wet himself during it was stress again coming out. The physical and emotional excertion on all part was difficult in the moment but worth it for Tam and me.\nDid I feel that I had let Tam and his mammy down? Yes I did. writing it right now, does it still feel that way? No, we did the right thing. The only thing I regret is that Bev has not seen her beautiful boy with his short hair and how grown up he looks.\nThen I look back on the statement I made about \u0026ldquo;that day I was lucky\u0026rdquo;. Well over the past months I thing I have changed my mind on that. I think it is to do with honesty and accepting the moment. I was honest with that barber (i wish I could remember his name). I did not ask for his sympathy, I gave him the moment to be compassionate and he excelled in it. I don\u0026rsquo;t know that much about him, I cannot even remember his name (I am crap with names) but what he did will stay with me. In a set of difficult circumstances, emotions and thoughts he brought us through.\nIt might just seem like a haircut but as any parent of an autistic child might be able to tell you - nothing is easy with the spice of autism thrown in.\nThanks again for reading.\nIf you are the barber that did this then please reach out to me.\nCheers\nAlan and Tam\n",

So chuffed that we went online and checked what was on at the pictures. No luck. Angry Birds 2 starts 2nd August.\nAs we were looking Tam pointed at Spiderman - Far from home. \u0026ldquo;Go to the pictures, Spiderman far from home\u0026rdquo;, again as clear as can be. Wow. Ok Tam we go to the pictures and see Spiderman.\nSo after 3 hours sleep Tam is up and by default so am I. He asks again \u0026ldquo;go to pictures Spiderman Far from Home\u0026rdquo;. Yes we are going to the pictures.\nPart of me is starting to worry. It\u0026rsquo;s not a special autistic viewing. It\u0026rsquo;s actually on in one of those 270 degree surround viewings. Over the next couple of hours I start worrying more about the sound (why are cinema\u0026rsquo;s so loud), the surrond screen and lots of other people being in the cinema. All triggers to a meltdown. The other part of me was so excited for Tam as he asked for this and his language was so clear. This is important to Tam, the effort to speak the sentence and be so clear means it is important.\nWe arrived at the cinema, bought our tickets. Tam hangs onto to them so tight and inspects them and we read every word on them. We have our second breakfast in the cinema before heading to the screen.\nWell worry number one is done, we are the only people in the screen. The adverts start and the second worry gets worse. The sound is soooooo loud. Tam is flinching and sticking his fingers in his ears. I want to leave the sound is so loud.\nFinally, with Tam jamming his fingers in his ears a demo of the 270 degree screen starts which is very disorientating, the feeling of the room tilting is worrying for how Tam is doing. I am watching for the meltdown.\nHalf way through the film and Tam is settled and engaged. The 270 degree parts of the film are more a reason to look around than meltdown. His fingers pop in his ears only during the louder parts of the action sequences. I start to relax and enjoy the film. The 270 degree sequences are few and left me wondering why the studios go to the expense and trouble. Also why are the tickets 50% more?\nAs usual we have to sit all the way through the credits, right to the very very end.\nNow Tam stands up with a big grin and wraps his arms around my neck and say \u0026ldquo;go home now\u0026rdquo;.\nMy boy always surprises me. Everyday he manages to do it. Today has been a good day.\nI hope yours was good.\nAlan and Tam\n",

    "body": "I have had a couple of days to reflect on the past week and what me and Tam are doing. It has taken a couple of days because of panic attacks that I have had with some of the stuff me and Tam need to do.\nTo be specific I will use one time which was dropping off Tam at the respite centre. After dropping him off I went to get the bus back home. A walk of less than a hundred yards. During that walk I got chest pains, my breathing went nuts and I thought I was going to fall over. It was all I could do to stay standing. I ended up sitting on the floor and trying to recover. The pain was real, the breathing was out of control. Panic attacks are horrible. I wanted to go back and get Tam and go home.\nThe bus came, I hauled myself up and got on the bus. I must have looked bad because the bus driver asked me if I was ok. \u0026ldquo;Fine\u0026rdquo; was my only answer and I sat down. Still my breathing was ragged, still my chest hurt.\nConvincing myself that Tam was safe was the only thing that started to restore some form of calm to myself. Panic level was still high and I just wanted to get home.\nLess than 30 minutes later I was home and sobbing. I could not get out of my head what Bev would be thinking of me putting Tam in respite. My brain and thoughts were torn in two. I knew in my heart that she would know that it was the right thing to do. Not the best thing, but OK. My head wanted her to scream at me and say \u0026ldquo;what the hell are you doing with our boy\u0026rdquo;.\nAn hour and a half had passed and the sobbing had stopped, the breathing was under control and the pain was subsiding. I was shattered. Surely sleep would come tonight.\nTo be clear, I don\u0026rsquo;t write this for sympathy. Sympathy does me or Tam no good. This is something I have to go through. This is something I have to endure for now. I have medication which sometimes works, but panic attacks are not planned and most certainly don\u0026rsquo;t give advanced warnings. Maybe I need to carry my medication with me and better understand the circumstances that might trigger an attack. That might be the best plan for now.\nThe reason I write this is because I know that many people have panic attacks for various reasons. My reasons are not better or worse than someone elses, they are just different. My reason is to be open and transparent about what is going on with our lives. I am trying my best to protect me and Tam from anymore hurt. That might be totally futile but I will use everything in my skill set to do be the best I can for him and me. Right now I have loads of questions about what the best mechanisms are. I will make mistakes, but I will either learn or win.\nDown to the point of this post. Don\u0026rsquo;t be frightened to be fragile or vulnerable. Share what scares you. Talk about what brings you down. Be honest with yourself and the ones around you. Finally be good to yourself and don\u0026rsquo;t be harsh to yourself. It is a learning process, eventually we will come out the otherside and be stronger and wiser.\nHave a wonderful day.\nAlan and Tam\n",

I am talking about supporting my son and part of that is understanding his complex behaviour and seeing things from his point of view.\nYou win or you learn is an important perspective for me. It reminds me that even when I come out of a situation with Tam I have to be positive and find the best way forward with that attitude. When dealing with your own personal grief and putting it on hold to support someone who is struggling with their grief it is all too easy to become depressed and down. That does not help either party and in our situation it is a major hinderance to moving forward.\nWe have all been in a situation with someone we know when you ask them how they are and they smile back and say they are fine. In that moment it does not take a body language expert to know they are not fine (unless its the acronym of F*cked up, Insecure, Neurotic and Emotional). The smile is false, the tone is depressed and slow and there is no belief in what they say.\nWell, Tam picks up on my moods so quickly that it can become a downwards spiral for both of us. So what do I do? I try my best to explain to Tam why daddy is sad. It is pointless to try to hide it. He is too connected into how I feel and for a lie would not be told, the anxiety that Tam might feel because he is sensing conflicting feelings would be counterproductive and would increase his anxiety levels.\nNow I am not saying that I have not put on the happy face mask and the jolly tongue poking exterior. I have. I used it as a survival tactic for a while. I managed to kid myself for a while with it as well. But I did not kid Tam. He saw right through it. It raised his anxiety, it made him angry. In the moment I kept it up, I put on the mask. I told him it would all be ok while inside I was screaming and crying and asking the question of WHY?\nIn time I learned that honesty with Tam worked better for both of us. He had seen me cry too many times and heard the lie \u0026ldquo;daddies ok\u0026rdquo;, he had struggled with the confusion and anxiety for long enough. I started to allow myself to tell him that \u0026ldquo;daddy missed mammy loads\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;daddy is very sad that Tam has lost his mammy\u0026rdquo;. Hard words to say when you don\u0026rsquo;t understand the level of understanding from a barely verbal boy.\nThe outcome of this difficult lesson is that Tam is more at ease with daddies grief, I am more at ease with Tams grief. It gives us a foundation for those sad mournful days and also for the days we laugh for the mammy that exists in our hearts.\nBe good to the ones you love\nThanks again for reading.\n",

It\u0026rsquo;s really the same school but a different site a few hundred metres away. It feels like a big change for him and me.\nThe days starts with a leaver assembly. Followed with a brief meeting with his new teacher Sarah. Get something to eat and maybe pop home and then back to school for a care meeting and pick Tam up for the last time from Site 1. It will be sad. Plus I will continuously be thinking about Bev not seeing her son on his last day at a school we visited so many times together.\nSix weeks holiday. We have some stuff planned but not enough.\nUpdate - 20/7/2019\nTam would not go into the leavers assembly,it was too noisy. The whole day was one of reflection. It was full of what if\u0026rsquo;s, all of them based around Bev not being there.\nI am pretty sure that Tam understands that it is now the holiday and he has no school for 6 weeks or so. He virtually collapsed last night when he got home. He was asleep by 10pm and did not stir until 11am. My boy slept.\nToday he has been cuddly and cannot really be bothered to do anything but we have been for a walk to get his favourite pizza. I feel his lethergy. I think today and tomorrow will be chill days and on Monday it\u0026rsquo;s another part of Tam\u0026rsquo;s adventure at the respite centre. Second nights stay, so it will be interesting to see how he copes. Plus he will spend more time there so its a bit of a different visit with no school in between. How will I cope, will it be a repeat of reflecting on the past 18 months, will it be grief descending like a heavy weight again. Control over what happens is not available to me so I am trying not to worry about it.\nThanks again for reading,\nAlan \u0026amp; Tam\n",

    "body": "Dropping Tam off at the respite centre was hard, especially after being at the beach with him all day. The drop off was quick and consisted of a kiss and a bye-bye. I hoped that all of the preparation had worked. I have talked to Tam many times about him staying at the centre and having an adventure and sleep over. With his lack of verbal comebacks it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to totally understand how much he understands. One part of me is that he understands almost everything, then there is the doubt and I think he is being thrown into things with no understanding and just terror and anxiety of what the hell is Dad doing, where has he gone. I wish I knew.\nPlans made for the night went out of the window. Grief took over for the night. Sleep was hard to come by.\nTime arrived to pick Tam up for school. I was excited to see my little man and see that he was OK. I knew deep inside that he would be.\nSo I was greeted with a cuddle and a kiss and then pushed towards the taxi. We had to get to school. We pulled into the car park, Tam jumped out and off to school with barely a look back at me.\nWhen I was thinking about his first respite stay I was worried about how Tam would react. Would he feel abandonded? I was no further in understanding his reaction to his respite stay. A few more hours before I got him home.\nSchool time finished and Tam is in the taxi with me, he\u0026rsquo;s cuddling in and asking for his fix of YouTube on my phone. Arrival home has Tam jumping out of the taxi and running to the door. Normally it\u0026rsquo;s a bit of a fight getting him home. Door opened, and at this point Tam shields his eyes. Bev collapsed just inside the door, for over 18 months he has shielded his eyes when passing that point. Tonight he stands tall and blows a kiss to the floor where Bev collapsed and off he ran up the stairs. I broke down crying, it was a salute to his mammy.\nFor the rest of the night Tam was cuddly and wanted tons of rough and tumble. He was also very chatty, asking for things in sentences rather than single words. What a difference. For one he had not fallen out with me for abandoning him. Two for his salute to his mammy and finally for his chatty night.\nSleep was not a huge battle, not simple but not hard.\nSo from the information I got from the respite centre, Tam was Tam. He asked to go home, he got a little disregulated and had a few moments of upset. Nothing that was not expected. He slept about 6 hours which would be a great night at home. Not bad, not bad at all.\nPart 2 of respite done. Part 3 next week for another overnight stay.\nHave a great day and thanks for reading.\nAlan\n",

    "body": "Written 16th July 23:00\nToday has been an emotional day. It is just before midnight and for the first time since Bev died Tam is not with me. He is at a respite centre a few miles away.\nEverything started to get hectic last night. I had to sort out a bag for beach day, a bag for Tam\u0026rsquo;s overnight at the respite centre and his school bag. Beach day required food to be prepared. The overnight bag needed a form filling in and all of his clothes marking. Tam went nuts when I tried to do it with him around. I had to wait for him to be settled in bed, which thankfully did occur. Not sure what I would have done if he did not sleep.\nSo 2 o\u0026rsquo;clock in the morning I finished getting the bags organised with just food to prepare in the morning. Off to bed for a few hours sleep.\nJust before 6 I was up preparing food that I knew Tam would have and making sure I had everything we needed. We got ready, bit of a problem for Tam as it was not school uniform for beach day and he wanted school uniform on. Eventually got over it. And off to get the taxi to school via the respite centre.\nI was like a pack horse. One backpack over one shoulder, another over the shoulder and a holdall being carried. And today Tam wanted loves on every step as we left the flat.\nBag dropped off at the respite centre, on to school. Arrive at school and Tam wants to get on the bus and get to the beach but we had to wait for the bus coming back from getting fuel. Tam does not have a great deal of patience. So time for a quick toilet visit and calm him with a little bit of YouTube time.\nHad a great day at the beach, walked the length of the beach and along a headland. Tam was nice and calm, apart from when I pushed him in the water to get him wet. You cannot visit the beach on a lovely summers day and not get wet. Had lots of fun with him. That fun is tinged very much by the person who is not there, Bev. She would have loved today. She would have been in her element and Tam would have been running back and forth between us. I could feel that he was missing his Mum.\nThen onto the next emotional part of the day, off to respite. We arrived, Tam jumped out of the taxi, turned to kiss me and said \u0026ldquo;bye, bye\u0026rdquo;. I was floored, emotionally floored. I know I had put the work in with Tam to ensure he knew what was going on today and what was expected of him but the way he just left me at the door with a kiss and bye bye. It floored me.\nAnyway back at home and I went out for a walk. Over 16k steps today. It felt like I had lost my soul with Tam not being around. It also hit me hard how much I missed Bev. I cried a lot tonight. It felt like the grief was back and it was not finished with me. I also wondered what Bev would be thinking about Tam being in respite. I had loads of unanswered questions about what she would be thinking, if should would be pleased with the things I was doing with Tam. Lots of questions I would never get an answer to. I miss her so much. The pain of her loss gets more everyday.\nFinal part of the day is that the respite centre called me earlier and basically described my little lads to me. He\u0026rsquo;s OK. He\u0026rsquo;s behaving not much different to how he would at home. Hopefully he is tired from a full on day and he sleeps tonight.\nAll I have to do is still my head and get some sleep. Alarm is on to get him from respite and get him to school. Hope he sleeps.\nSleep well and may all of your dreams come true.\nAlan\n",

    "body": "Tam is at times very difficult to engage. His favourite things are tickles and rough and tumble. After that its his iPad and TV remote. By TV remote I mean that Tam has ultimate control of the TV with the ability to change channel and fast forward and rewind.\nToys are very hit and miss. Lego can lead to hours of play or a few seconds. Train sets normally require me to set them up and again Tam will either play for a little bit or just take it apart. So any toy that catches his attention and has multiple plays over a time are brilliant.\nFrom the point of bought toys we have two that Tam loves, both light based. The first are bath light toys. Since the day he got them he has used them in the bath every time. For a recommendation Tam gives them a 10/10.\nhttps://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B01N30OPSF\nThe next item is his goto for when he get too spun up. He grabs a furry blanket and his cushion with LED lights in it and hides under the blanket. When he uses the cushion I know he is trying to self regulate. It is brilliant that he goes to this place and tries to regulate himself and that his cushion helps with it. The lights pulse gently and fur is nice and soft. Tam highly recommends it. 10/10\nhttps://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/8329002071\nApart from his iPad those two toys get the most playtime, both bought by Uncle Mickey.\nThey are however not his only toys. One thing that I think most autistic kids like is fiddle toys. Tams goto fiddle toy are plastic straws (god help us if they are banned). He always has at least one. He uses them as drumsticks, he plays with them in his mouth and they give him comfort. I have to stockpile them and people who know Tam give me boxes of straws for him. Straws.\nLastly a thing we have started to do which Tam finds fascinating is to 3D fidget toys. We have printed loads of them. Some last and some don\u0026rsquo;t. The ones he likes at the moment are some octipi, some gimbals that you blow on to make them spin and a container with a screw thread that means gravity spins it.\nToys are difficult for all kids and are subject to moments of \u0026ldquo;got to have\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;obscurity in the cupboard\u0026rdquo;. For autistic kids it is just wonderful to find something that entertains them.\nNo matter your edge don\u0026rsquo;t every lose the child in you.\nTake care\nAlan \u0026amp; Tam\n",

    "body": "Today me and Tam were separated for longest time. We spent 6 hours apart on a weekend. Yes, we are separate when Tam goes to school. This was only the second time in the last 18 months that we have been separate, but the last time I was in the same building. Today Tam went to a respite centre with me and I left him there. He went off to the beach and I went home.\nIt was a strange feeling. From 11am until 5pm he was with someone else on a Saturday.\nJust to be clear today did not just happen. It has taken a lot of visits and the staff at the respite centre have worked to get to this point. It has taken time but it has been well worth it.\nFor 18 months since Bev\u0026rsquo;s death me and Tam have been together all week, every week with only school as a break. 18 months of being in each others pockets. No one with the skills to be able to support Tam without me being with them.\nBoth me and Tam have had to work towards today. We have had to build up our strength, our indepence from each other in our grief, and our trust in each other to be ok doing this. It has taken a lot of work.\nI still had anxieties. I was worried about how Tam would feel. Whether he would be mad at me for leaving him? Or would he be in a mood with me for something that happened there? I had a multitude of worries. A multitude of concerns.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s 9pm right now, Tam is in bed. He is quiet, chilled and entertained with his iPad for 20 more minutes. I have a feeling he might be asleep before then.\nThis is part 1 of his respite care. The next part takes place in a couple of days when he stays overnight. That will be the first time. That gives me a different bunch of worries.\nBe strong in what you do.\nTake care\nAlan and Tam\n",

    "body": "During the time since Bev died a particular kind of music and a particular band have given both me and Tam a lot of solice.\nThat band is Alterbridge. A rock band that I don\u0026rsquo;t like to put in a particular pigeon hole, they are Alterbridge.\nBev came to know Alterbridge through me and loved the vibe of the band and she loved the loud songs but also loved the quieter songs that they do. Most of all she loved the story telling that the lyrics gave and the music that added the soul to the songs. But really she loved looking at Myles Kennedy the principal singer in the band. She really loved looking at Myles and listening to Myles.\nOn of the things I would often come home to was Bev and Tam dancing to an Alterbridge track. It was something that all of us had as a family. The love of Alterbridge and the stories that they told through there music.\nAnyway a counsellor asked me to give her the names of a few tracks as I had brought them up in so many sessions. I gave her a list and a week went past. I arrived at my next session and was asked by the lead counsellor if I was happy if she discontinued our sessions and I moved on to a new counsellor. Listening to the music she recognised our story and in getting as she described \u0026ldquo;super-emotional\u0026rdquo; she felt she was too close to the emotional stresses and could not keep a professional distance. I had one more session with her and decided to take a break from counselling sessions. She left me in a better place and I knew that I had got to a place that I had to stand on my own two feet for a bit. Once last thing she said is that I should reach out to the band and explain just how important the music had been in our lives as well as in mine and Tam\u0026rsquo;s life after such a devastating turn of events. So I did.\n To: support@janusmusicmgmt.com\nWould you be please help me and pass this onto someone at Alterbridge. Thank you.\nTo Alterbridge\nMark, Flip, Brian, and Myles,\nI wanted to reach out and thank you for providing us with such brilliant music and lyrics that I know have not just affected my family but many others as well.\nWriting a letter/email like this is not something I would normally do and this came out of a conversation with a counsellor. So please bear with me as I would like you to know and understand just how profound your music is in what some might call exceptional circumstances.\nMy partner Bev and me met in 1999. We had a son named Tam Samuel in September 2007 after having several miscarriages and trying for 5 years. We were ecstatic. Over time we realised that something was not quite right with his development and started on a journey to understand what was going on with Tam. in 2009 he was diagnosed with Autism. I think at the time we blamed ourselves and wondered what we did wrong. I think for a while we grieved. Anyway we just got on with it and loved Tam and his quirks and made every effort to make the world more understandable for him and enrolled him into a fantastic special school for autistic kids. Our grief lessened and our boy showed us a new way of seeing the world. We learnt more from him then we could ever teach him.\nA few years later when Tam was 7 a friend offered to look after Tam for a few hours so that me and Bev could go out for a valentines night meal. Both of us were uncertain but we did. While we were out and had just started the meal I got a phone call to say that my Father (who was known to his friends as Mat and who we named Tam after) had been rushed into hospital and that I had to get to the hospital. He died aged 93 without regaining consciousness the next morning.\nOver the next few months I realised that my Dad had been hiding a problem from us. My Mother had dementia, she was hallucinating and was not able to look after herself. She went downhill very quickly most days not knowing her husband was dead or who I was. Two years later found peace and died. I found this time very difficult.\nAt both of their funerals we played \u0026ldquo;In Loving Memory\u0026rdquo;.\nWell time passed and Bev helped to stitch me back together. We started to make new plans with a new view on life and your music was a continuous stream in our world. Bev and Tam would dance together to any one of the tracks in your catalogue. Yes they had favourites but it did not matter, they had their Alterbridge daft dance on and it was a joy to watch them.\nRoll forward to Christmas 2017. Tam had broken up for Christmas, I took a few days off because we felt like this was the first Christmas that Tam understood what was going on. He was still non verbal but growing up fast. Christmas Eve we got him to sleep and we poured some wine put Alterbridge on and wrapped his presents. (I know this Alterbridge thing is boring but it was part of the stream of our lives)\nWell during the night Tam could not rest. He had a real heavy cold and was very lethargic. So we made a decision to postpone Christmas for a couple of days until he was well enough to enjoy it. Plus with Tam not being verbal we have to keep a very close eye on him when he is not well. We have to second guess how is doing as he cannot tell us. He spent all Christmas day sleeping.\nI went to work on Boxing day even though Tam was not well and earned a day off later in the week. Tam took a couple of days for him to start to get back to normal. Well Bev got his \u0026lsquo;cold\u0026rsquo;. On the morning of the 28th she was not well and I phoned the Doctor and we were asked to go to the medical centre to get her checked over. She had a little rattle in her breathing. She got showered and ready and I called a taxi. As we were waiting for the taxi and joking how the world slowed down between Christmas and New Year I decided to phone the taxi company again. When I got off the phone Bev\u0026rsquo;s lips had turned blue. She had stopped breathing. I called the ambulance and performed CPR all the time with Tam watching this. She was rushed into hospital and died the next day. She died of Japanese flu with complications. She was 49. Her 50th birthday was 9 months away.\nTam lost his Mammy and I lost my soul mate. It felt like the world had ended. At Bev\u0026rsquo;s funeral we played \u0026ldquo;In Loving Memory\u0026rdquo; and the middle section of \u0026ldquo;Blackbird\u0026rdquo;. Bev loved the wail of the two guitar solos.\nWell months later still numb, Tam started to play \u0026ldquo;Wonderful Life\u0026rdquo; on his iPad. He came and sat next to me and said \u0026ldquo;Miss Mammy, Tam sad\u0026rdquo; we both cried. I knew for the first time that he really understood. I talked to him about the lyrics of Wonderful life and In Loving Memory. We had an incredibly bittersweet moment together and we bonded tighter than I could have ever imagine in that moment. That day I stopped trying to give Tam the comfort his mammy gave him and instead we now use those two songs. It brings us peace and perfect memories, it gives us both solice that we had such a wonderful life with her and we continue to take her along on this journey. She may not stand beside us but we carry her along with us and your music continues in our new stream of life.\nI thank you for your patience in reading this, I thank you for your wonderful lyrics, I thank you for your mastery of your specific instruments and even though I have only seen you in interviews I thank you for being beautiful human beings. I wish you all the success with the new album later this year and hope that I can make arrangements to be able to see you in concert. Being a sole parent to an autistic boy it is difficult to get external support.\nTake care and pass our love to all of your families and loved ones. Never ever take them for granted.\nAlan and Tam Greenwell\n I hope they read it.\nIf you want to know more about the band please visit https://alterbridge.com\nAnyway do a nice thing, say thanks to someone, I guarantee it will make both your day and theirs.\nTake care and thanks for reading.\nAlan and Tam\n",

    "description": "",
    "body": "An idea was given to me early on to put together a memory box of things for Tam to use when he is thinking of Mammy.\nTam\u0026rsquo;s school provided the box and I set to filling it. It was a difficult thing to do at the time. Now looking into the things I have put into it and the reverence and care give to the box and it\u0026rsquo;s contents it was well worthwhile.\nThe box has photos, perfume, a pair of socks, some keys, her purse and all kinds of other things.\nTam does not often pick it up and look in it, its kind of a big event when he does. He is quiet and he looks through the box with so much care.\nWell I get something into my head that the memory box is a help to both me and Tam. So i decided to extend the idea to a memory wall. I see-sawed over the idea for a few weeks and one day I was out and saw some bright orange paint. Orange was Bev\u0026rsquo;s favourite colour. I bought the paint.\nA few days later I had a bright orange wall, a bunch of photos printed and some frames delivered and I completed the wall.\nI was so anxious when I picked Tam up from school to take him home to see this memory wall.\nHe sat and looked at each photo. Not upset in anyway. He pulled me close and pointed at a picture and pressed my throat. His signal to \u0026ldquo;tell me about this\u0026rdquo;. So i explained to him about the day we took the photo. He listened intently. He pointed at the next photo and pressed my throat and explained. This went on for a couple of hours. No upset, no crying, just a big set of moments between us. To this day we still have moments where he asks for the story behind the photo. Its our chill time, it our moment of reflection, its our sweet memories of our loved one that is still with us in our hearts but missed more each day.\nBoth the memory box and wall where hard things to do at the time but have been such powerful things for both me and Tam to use to reflect on the wonderful times we had with Bev.\nBe good to yourself, tell the ones you love that you love them and take care,\nAlan\n",

    "title": "An Average Tough Day",
    "date": "",
    "description": "",
    "body": "Written 3rd July 2019\nYesterday started 15 minutes earlier than is usual. I got Tam to sleep about 9pm with a mixture of drugs, conversation (one sided) and pleas to his better nature. Still not sure which of them was the most effective. The big problem was with all of that his sleep only lasted until 11:45pm. With a flourish and a joyful scream he was up and wide awake and getting ready for school. School felt like a long way off and all attempts to get him back to bed caused a spiral that was not going to end well. So a return to bed and sleep for me was taken off the todo list and the long night began.\nOn nights when Tam does not sleep the only way to have a calm night is to sit on the sofa in the place that Bev used to sit. If I spend too much time away from that safe spot then Tam starts to get upset.\nAnother part of the night is Tam asking every 20 minutes or so \u0026ldquo;going to school?\u0026rdquo; to which I have to answer \u0026ldquo;Yes, you are going to school\u0026rdquo;. If I dont answer it in a particular way then the time between each ask reduces. It is a long night and even when the sun comes up there is a few hours before school.\n8:30am eventually arrived and after 2 breakfasts Tam went to school. Long night done. Time to do a bit of work. Oh crap the computer has crashed, no worries restart it autosaves. Power off computer, won\u0026rsquo;t power on. A couple of hours diagnosing problem and the power supply is not working. Power supplies when they fail normally take other more expensive things down. So, I order a new power supply (Â£90), and see where we are. (UPDATE: not good had to order a motherboard for Â£150, lets hope the processor is alright, that would be another Â£300).\nAt this point its mid day and my alarm tells me its time to eat (left to my own internal clock and I won\u0026rsquo;t eat until Tam gets home). After eating there is no time to get some sleep, only time to put some washing in, vacuum and do a bit of tidy up from the long morning.\n2:40pm off to get Tam from school. As I approach I can see he is some spare pants. He\u0026rsquo;s had a day at Alnwick gardens and has been in the fountain. I have to laugh. Off home with more washing with my pond swamp of a boy.\n4:00pm decide we have to go to the shops. Tam wants a cake at Starbucks as we walk past. It been a part of our routine since Bev died and it give me 15 minutes to catch my breath and sip my coffee from a takeaway cup. When Tam is finished he has to leave. No arguments or even the offer of another cake helps (that\u0026rsquo;s why a takeaway cup). So, we go into Starbucks and it is nice a quiet. Tam goes off to the preferred seat and in a split second picks up a drink and pours it over himself. No longer does he smell like a swamp, he now smells of coffee and sickly syrup. Great. Time to go home, and yes he had his cake. Again not worth the fight of just leaving.\n6:00pm Now its time for the coffee and syrup smelling boy to decide he does not want a bath and we settle for a shower. Hurrah, we have a win. It might sound like I gave up, it might sound like a little win, but on this day it is a HUGE win.\nCountdown to bed time. He is shattered, I am shattered. Nerves are frayed but I am giving off all of the vibes of being chilled and relaxed. Inwardly, no so calm. Praying for an easy bedtime, anxiety at breathless levels. Outwardly chilled, inwardly sobbing at what might be.\nBedtime v2 Bedtime is rough. Its a fight to get the iPad away from Tam, he does not want to go to bed. I eventually get him to bed, put on his stars and music, kiss him and basically plead with him to sleep. I then tell him how his Mammy would want him to get his sleep. He might sleep and dream about Mammy. Sleep happens 3 hours later and I need to sleep.\nHead hits pillow 30 minutes later and I am wired. Absolutely wired, heart clattering in my chest, mind whirling. Sleep seems miles away.\nEventually I lose the waking edge of life and sleep. The day is done.\nThe next thing I feel is Tam landing on me full force and giggling. \u0026ldquo;Going to school?\u0026rdquo;. \u0026ldquo;Yes you are going to school\u0026rdquo;, the sun is up, the day starts better.\nHave an excellent day, be good to the ones you love and take care,\nAlan\n",

    "description": "",
    "body": "Any parent knows that when their child is ill that it is the most worrying of times. When a child is a bit quiet and complains of a belly ache any normal parent thinks a couple of polar opposite things at the same time. \u0026ldquo;I told you to stop eating so many strawberries\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;its appendicitis, and it about to burst\u0026rdquo;, both of these are normal reactions and you talk to your child to help make the decision as to what it is and before you get a chance to work it out they left off a large fart and are off playing again. It\u0026rsquo;s normal. Absolutely normal. When that does not happen and you end up in A\u0026amp;E at 2 in the morning well that\u0026rsquo;s a different story all together.\nI think most people (especially parents) will recognise that situation, anyone who doesn\u0026rsquo;t, they will when they have children. Well step into the shoes of a parent with an ASD child who is minimally verbal or non verbal. Imagine getting no feedback from your child, imagine having a child who laughs and giggles when they bang there shin off a door stop and have a massive lump and bruise but just giggle where a typical child would be screaming. Now think about the scenario I outlined and remove any verbal communication.\nIllness\u0026rsquo;s both major and minor come up with no warning, the initial verbal indicators are not present. The discomfort is not signalled, the pain might present the opposite response to what is expected. All of the normal indicators are messed up and jumbled. The signs and symptoms contradict each other. The first you know that something is wrong is a 39C temperature and a non responsive child. From zero to emergency.\nOn top of that ASD kids can be sneaky as well, we had a situation once with Tam where every time we gave him a drink he was finding a way to dispose of it. We were totally unaware he was doing this. We were totally unaware of the reasons why he was doing this. He ended up in hospital dehydrated. How you ask? Well if a child has a sore throat you hear it in there voice and you would a administer some medicine and or ice cream. What if the child is non verbal and there throat hurts and keeps being given a drink and it hurts more when they drink. What if their mum or dad makes them drink and it hurts, this little feedback loop without further information does not go well. No visible physical indicator of trouble, an invisible problem occurring and danger close approaching. It does not take long to become very ill if you are getting no fluids.\nIt only took a couple of hour at the hospital to get him rehydrated and a physical struggle with several member of the nursing team for the doctor to see he had very inflamed tonsils.\nInflamed tonsils is one thing, think of all of the childhood ailments in the situation I have described.Then think of those ailments slowly taking hold until they show symptoms. It is a continual worry and a continual effort to stay on top of Tam\u0026rsquo;s health.\nSince Bev died I have had to deal with a lot of issues with Tam\u0026rsquo;s health brought on by his lack of sleep and general anxiety. As a single parent with no one else to say those immortal words - \u0026ldquo;oh, he\u0026rsquo;s fine it\u0026rsquo;s just\u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;..\u0026rdquo; is difficult. The support and understanding I have had from the medical professionals I have come across has been both very understanding of the situation and very professional. They have listened to me, worked with me and reassured me when needed.\nOne day I will get back to the point of being much calmer in these situations but for now I have to accept the situation and jump between reassuring myself and panicking.\n",

    "body": "This is a subject I was going to stay away from but I have had loads of emails, mostly from America on the subject of autism \u0026lsquo;cures\u0026rsquo; and how to make Tam well again. I have to say I was surprised and was not expecting the number of emails but the content has been sickening. I would have much preferred spam about anything else.\nOf all the emails the majority talk about these Miracle Supplement available on the internet. Some from entities purporting to be from religious groups, some from what appear to be parents of \u0026lsquo;autistic\u0026rsquo; children explaining the miracle that took place.\nI looked at the claims from a perspective of lets see what these idiots are droning on about. They nearly all came down to them selling sodium chlorite \u0026lsquo;sacraments\u0026rsquo; or vials. They instruct you to mix it with citric acid and use it as an enema or get the child to drink it. Well a little bit of chemistry is that the result of mixing these two things is BLEACH. For the sake of humanity and children these people are asking parent to get there children to drink BLEACH. Chlorine Dioxide is classified as an oxidising agent and its main uses are in bleaching wood pulp and disinfection. Any parent that has done this to their child needs serious help.\nI suppose I should not have expected anything else from America. The land that treats peoples ailments as a method of removing money from people and bankrupting families. I used to work in the pharmaceutical world and I saw the prices the NHS paid against what the Americans charged people. America deserves all it gets. A health system run as a profit making business, whose major role is to keep the shareholders and owners in champagne.\nSo a number of Americans think that giving a bleach enema to Tam will cure him. I cannot understand the level of sickness that people must have to peddle this as a cure. They are beyond ignorant and do not display anything like being a human being. There should be an island that we ship people like that to and leave them there.\nRight now I have a filter on my email to push any emails from America to a folder of its own. I will check it periodically to see if there are any serious emails in there and purge the crap. Anyone who wants to email me about \u0026lsquo;miracle cures\u0026rsquo; well don\u0026rsquo;t bother. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to hear about your drivel and crap and you will not sell me anything, so bugger off and bother someone else. Or drink your own miracle sure because you have a sickness preying on people with you lies.\nFinally if anyone from the UK emails me with this crap please don\u0026rsquo;t and don\u0026rsquo;t tell me that you have used such a thing on your child. If you do I will inform social services and the police as your child is not safe in your care.\nI think I have made myself clear.\n",

    "body": "I am not totally sure of my reasons for writing a blog or a book at the moment. All I know is that the main subject that I have been writing about, my son, his autism and grief are important to me. I have looked for research and guidance on the web and elsewhere and have found little of substance. There might be on Facebook and maybe stuff is hidden on there, but I am not on Facebook. I donât particularly like social media and I am more comfortable having a phone call or one to one interaction that tweeting about things. Plus I have removed myself from world news and social media so that I can be more proactive with Tam and kinder to myself by ignoring the ignorance and stupidity that seems to be in control of things.\nI did think of taking writing courses and maybe finding an online course to improve my writing but my internal voice keeps putting this off. I have started writing content based on my scatter gun thoughts and making a headline and an outline and dumping my thoughts in the moment. Then I am revisiting those headlines and rough thoughts as they take me. At this point I have about 80 plus headlines or subjects. It is a challenge and it will be interesting to see where this takes me.\nIf you invest your precious time into reading what I post I hope that somewhere I help you in some small way. You are more than welcome if you want to reach out to me. Please email me (Contact form on the bottom of this post), I will reply with my answer which will have contact details on. If you feel the need to give me feedback, then please give it as constructively as possible. If you want to criticise then go somewhere else for your kicks, I donât think you will appreciate the kind of response that I will give.\nThis exercise might end up being a totally cathartic and I might be shouting into the void and vacuum of cyberspace. Either way I decided to do this so that if someone came across this while going through the difficulties of grief with an autistic person, that it might be of some small help.\nJust a last note, if you are expecting a linear read from day one until now, I am sorry you will be disappointed. I might feel able to organise my thoughts at a later point but right now it will be a scatter gun approach that at times will be contradictory.\nBe good to yourself and take care,\nAlan \u0026amp; Tam\nClick on the envelope below the logo to email me.\n",

    "body": "  Beautiful Mammy Bev\n  A few days after Christmas 2017 our world collapsed. Bev, my partner and my sonâs mummy died very suddenly. Tam saw his mammy go from holding his hand and cuddling him to me performing CPR and the next day seeing her for the last time. This blog is a bit of our journey, struggles and successes. I hope that if you invest your time in reading it that you get something from it and hopefully in some way it helps you.\n  Banana Fight\n  Tam was diagnosed on the Autism Spectrum in 2009. He is a bright, mischevious boy who loves cuddles and tickle fights. I am still not sure exactly what he understands about his mammy dieing. He still continually asks for her.\nI am now a full time Dad, and I cannot see that ever changing as Tam needs all of the physical, emotional and love energy that I have.\nAlan and Tam\n",

    "description": "The computers we use",
    "body": "  Our Desk\n  I make no apology for this being a bit technical. I will try and write a preamble to this that explains things more simply for people who are interested in the tools I use.\nThe world is electronic whether we like it or not. And as someone who has spent his working life in the information technology world all his working life I have a slightly different approach to computers, tablets and phones than I think the majority of people have. Now I will say up front that I do not play computer games. Even if I had time I donât think I would use my time to play computer games. To be totally open I used to play games on computers and consoles but it was a limited amount and mostly a social situation.\nSo what do I use computers for? Well in the sleep deprived world that me and Tam exist in a lot of time is in making to-do lists and prioritising those lists. Another is making sure I have important things written down. I suppose in short a computer to me is a tool much like a pen.\nThe tools we use\nHackintosh For a long time I have used Apple computers, and I actually worked for Apple for a while. I used them because they just worked. The software and the hardware worked. That was the beauty of them. I donât know if its the fact that I worked for Apple for over 5 years or that they just are way too expensive for what they are or even the not so small fact that the hardware is not very good any more but I am not spending my money on Apple products any more. My hackintosh is a stop gap measure until I have extracted myself from the Apple ecosystem and have got all of my data copied away.\nFor now though my Â£1200 hackintosh outperforms anything that Apple currently sells and is just as stable.\nI use a desktop because it gives me a place to work and concentrate on the things I need to do. Right now that is really important to me. Also using a desktop gives me access to much better monitors than a laptop provides. So for now my desk where my hackintosh sits is my workhorse. Once I am away from the Apple ecosystem it will become a Linux workstation that I will use in much the same way.\nSoftware I use on this ranges from Apples office programs, Pages, Numbers and Keynote to specialist programs like AutoCAD Fusion 360.\nDell XPS 13 This beautiful little machine is without doubt the best laptop I have ever owned. I got in very cheap in a sale and it performs beautifully. It has all of the ports I need to connect to storage drives, printers, cameras etc.. Plus it has plenty of speed and storage. The 4k screen is brilliant, the keyboard is top notch and the battery life is basically all day.\nIt is running Debian Linux and has been super stable. I cannot praise my little computer enough. I am typing this on it.\nLogitech Trackball On my hackintosh I use a Logitech Trackball version MX Ergo. It is brilliant and paired with the ultra-wide screen allows me to zip around the screen without using up loads of desk space. The battery is lasting multiple months on a charge and I have never needed to clean it.\nOne of the things I love is that you can program the multiple buttons to do different things. I have a couple of buttons programmed to scroll back and forth across the five workspaces that I use.\nMechanical Keyboard I tend to type a lot and cannot express how much nicer a mechanical keyboard is to type on. I am not going to say the make as the feel of a mechanical keyboard is a personal preference.\nLG Ultrawide (LG 34UM88C) If you want to be more productive then buy an ultra-wide monitor. They are sanity and time savers. On each of the workspaces I use I can split up the programs to either use the full screen or split the screen into 2 or 3 parts to run more programs. For instance I have a workspace that has the calendar on the left third, email on the right third and my to-do tracker in the middle. It is the only way to work, believe me, once you try an ultra-wide monitor you will not go back.\nEpson ET-4750 Printer I hate printers, but I have found a printer that I can live with and that does not cost a fortune to run. I bought it about a year ago and I have probably printed about 1000 plus pages. I am still on the first lot of ink and I have spare bottles of ink waiting. I reckon the ink will possibly run out in a couple of years time. Yes, you did hear all of that right. For 3 whole years I will not have had to buy ridiculous costing ink cartridges.\nThe Epson uses a thing called Ecotank. You fill the tanks up with bottles of ink. It is really simple. Other big pluses with this printer are duplex printing (both sides) and a really good document scanner. Again a product I would hate to do without now.\nFuji X-E3 Camera When Bev died I sold all of my cameras. I did not see the point in having a camera. Well one day I was killing time waiting for Tam coming out of school and ended up playing with the Fuji X-E3. I was hooked. Great little camera with a bit of a nostalgic feel that takes beautiful pictures. Got a couple of nice lenses with it as well.\nElgato StreamDeck Another time saver but this one is difficult to explain. Best way to think about it is a little keyboard that you can program to do multiple tasks with the touch of one button. Plus you can display what you want on the buttons as each button has a little LCD display.\n3D Mouse and Streamdeck I have about 200 actions programmed on mine all sorted into folders depending on what I am doing. A little taste of what it can do is that I have a button programmed to move to my third workspace and open 4 programs and arrange them on the screen so that they are in the places I want them. Another key is programmed to lock the house door, turn off the lights, run a program to dim the hall light down slowly and turn the TV off, and finally shut the computer down.\nIt takes a little bit of setting up but once done it is a great tool.\n3DConnexion Spacemouse Another one that is hard to explain. Its a mouse that does not move much! You pull, push and twist it! And the main reason I have it is so that I can do 3D design work. Not many people need on, but it makes designing so much more intuitive.\nNAS drives All the documents and photos and videos are stored and backed up on a couple of devices called network attached storage devices. It means that I can access them from anywhere and everything is automatically backed up.\n",
